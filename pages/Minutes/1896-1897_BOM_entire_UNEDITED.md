### Seventh Year. 

### [Board of Managers] Meeting of September 30th, 1896.

The Board of Management of the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore, on Wednesday, September 30th, 1896, met--by invitation--at La Paix, the country home of the President. There were nine members present: the President,--Second Vice President,--two Secretaries,--Miss Balch,--Miss Brent,--Miss Grace,--Miss Morris,--and Mrs. Uhler.

After pleasant greetings the President called the meeting to order; and the Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of May 5th, 1896.--The first business taken up related to the clock, which had, for some time, held a place in our assembly room, on approbation; and has since--during our vacation--been removed to the keeping of the firm by whom it had been sent to us. Some explanations were made with regard to this removal to the warehouse of Mr. Hiss, the owner. The need for a clock; the advantages possessed by the one under consideration; and the proposition to buy it, were discussed. The original price was seventy dollars--$70--and five dollars--$5--had been expended by the owner for having it put in excellent condition,

[119]

making the proposed expenditure for it seventy five dollars--$75.--Mrs. Morris made a motion "that we buy this clock". An enquiry with regard to the state of the treasury was satisfactorily answered by the President, who read the statement of the Treasurer, showing a balance of one hundred and sixty six dollars--$166--from the funds of last year. Miss Grace seconded the motion to buy the clock under consideration. The motion was carried; with no opposition. The President said it was proper that the same committee, to which this matter had been intrusted last year, should continue in charge of it: the Committee being Miss Balch and Mrs. Dammann. The Second Vice President, Mrs. Manly mentioned that it had been said that to keep good time permanently the clock must be fastened to the wall. Miss Grace, and others, thought it would be sufficient to make the feet level, or to render the clock perpendicular by other means than fastening. The question of obtaining authority to do so fasten it arose. Miss Balch was requested to have an interview with Mr. Hiss, and learn

[120]

if this matter can be arranged without danger of any inquiry to the wall.

The President then proposed that the first meeting of the Club for this year, on October 6th, should be a Salon, making our social meeting to come at the beginning of the month, instead of at the end of it. To this the Board agreed. The President appointed as the House Committee for the new year; Mrs. Manly, Second Vice President, Chairman, and Mrs. Uhler and Mrs. Morris, the other members. It was proposed that we should have two keys to the Committee Room,--for the Chairman of the House Committee and for the Corresponding Secretary.

The President then showed to the Board the Medal sent from the Columbian Exposition of 1893, at Chicago, to our Woman's Literary Club. in recognition and honor of the books sent to it by us. The Diploma, which accompanied the medal will be framed, and placed on the wall of our assembly room.

The President then committed to Mrs. manly the business of renewing the insurance on the pictures sent to us by the Century Magazine

[121]

Company; requesting her to confer with the Treasurer, and to have the insurance renewed in due time.

The President gave an account of the exercises proposed for the first meeting of the year on the following Tuesday. She spoke of the wish of the Chairman of the Committee on Autographs to present a good collection to the Club. She announces her intention to present to the Club the Photograph of her Italian picture "The Master Light of All our Seeing".

It was announced that the Address of the President at the close of the last year, printed by the request of the Club, would be ready for distribution to the members at the meeting of October 6th. Arrangements were made for sending this address to other Clubs and friends.

The meeting adjourned;--and the members of the Board enjoyed a stroll though the pleasant grounds of La Paix, and a refreshing collation within its walls.

The sum of ten dollars was agreed upon as the appropriation for flowers.

The second subject considered was that of the Heliotype pictures of the Boston Library, which has been offered to the Academy of Sciences, and by it to our Club also, for exhibition. Arrangements were discussed for the proper

[123]

The addition of some very desirable conveniences to the rooms occupied the Club in the building of the Academy of Sciences was proposed; and the questions of ability and feasibility were amicably discussed from several points of view. It was suggested that the approach of the holidays would interfere with the

[124]

accomplishment of much work before the end of the year. Finally Mrs. Uhler was requested to learn the opinions of her husband, the President of the Academy of Sciences, on the most important of these questions.

The Treasurer made a satisfactory report of the condition of the Treasurer.

The question of making our Library available for the use of our members was also brought forward. It was suggested that the Librarian should be consulted on this subject. There was also a suggestion of the appointment of an assistant if the work of taking charge of the books is increased.

### [Board of Managers] Meeting of February 9th, 1897.

The President presented the subject of the Congress of Mothers of Washington on the 17th of February,--to which meeting our Club had been invited to send delegates. After some discussion, and information given with regard to the Congress and its officers, the Board agreed that as a Literary Club, we could certainly take part in the work of the proposed convention,--so far as it should relate to the literature that ought to be given to children and young people. It was proposed that a Committee,

[129]

appointed by the President, and of which she should be Chairman, should go to Washington, and attend one or more of the meetings of the Congress. The President named as the other members of the Committee, Mrs. Hill, Mrs. Percy [Elizabeth McCormick] Reese, Mrs. Dammann, Mrs. Haman, Miss Whitney, Miss Cloud, Miss [Lizette Woodworth] Reese, and Miss Brent,--subject to their acceptance, of course. *Over.

The President then brought to our notice the subject presented by Miss Malloy regarding a proposed House of Detention in our city for children and youthful offenders against the law. The members of the Board agreed that this important subject ought to claim our attention and assistance as individual women, though not distinctly as a Literary Club.

The President then informed the Board of a request made to her by a Mr. Armor, who was compiling a book giving an account of the--non political--Clubs of Baltimore; and who wished to include the Woman's Literary Club among those described in his publication,--with the names of its members, a picture of its meeting place, and other items. She had told him that any consent of ours would depend on

[130]

the nature of the list of Clubs he should obtain; which decision was of course approved by the Board.

The President then received from the Treasurer the bill of $24.50, for plumbing work lately done for the benefit of the Club. The bill was approved by the Board.

Two resignations were announced with great regret; but it was finally understood that one of them would be withdrawn (Mrs. Maitland), and that the other (Mrs. [Martha Lee] Jenkins) would result in a non-resident membership.

The meeting adjourned.

*The Committee did not--as a Committee--go to Washington, but were understood to hold under consideration the subject of "Literature for Children and Young People".

### [Board of Managers] Meeting of May 4th, 1897.

[131]

Balch, Miss Grace, Mrs. Morris, Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Uhler, and later Miss Brent.

The President announced that for this meeting--the first Tuesday in May--the business before us was the election of new members.

An amicable discussion arose on the preliminary measures most advisable in the admission of candidates for membership, in order to ascertain their qualifications or suitability for admission into the Club. It was proposed that each candidate should be required to write a paper; or, at least, show some decided evidence of her literary ability before any action is taken on the application for her membership. This proposal though it seemed to meet approval was deferred for a decision in the future.

The only proposed name that had been received by the Recording Secretary was that of Miss Giffin, 1004 Charles Street. She was proposed by Mrs. Frederick [Florence McIntyre] Tyson, and seconded by Mrs. Bullock and Mrs. Lord. After information asked and given,

[132]

Miss Giffin was elected without dissent.

The President then proposed for honorary membership the name of Madame Blanc of Paris, France; which of course received the consent of the Board.

Mrs. Wrenshall then proposed--for honorary membership also--her relation Miss Charlotte Yonge of England, the well known writer; which, of course, also received the assent of the Board.

The President then spoke of the Reading to be given in Baltimore by Miss Mary Field, daughter of the Author, Eugene Field. She said it had been proposed that a delegation of our Club should call upon Miss Field; and that those of our members who wish to attend her reading should go and sit together on the evening when it is given. The Committee of the Board appointed to call on Miss Field was then appointed. Mrs. Morris then presented the Report of the Special Committee on the preparation of the Dressing Room;--describing the work done, and the recording money paid for it. The report was approved by

[133]

the Board of Management.

Some proposals were presented by the House Committee with regard to the cleaning and renovating carpets and curtains, the winding of the Clock, and the question of having two keys to the door of the upper room,--which were discussed and approved.

The resignation of Mrs. F. X. Ward was presented.

Mrs. Smith presented the resignation of her sister, Mrs. Maitland,--who has left Baltimore, to reside in Brooklyn--or Greater New York.

The meeting adjourned.
