**Meeting of October 5th, 1897.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, October the 5th, 1897, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was the opening one of the season of 1897, and 1898.

The programme was under the direction of Miss Lizette [Woodworth] Reese, Chairman of the Committee on Poetry.

The President called the meeting to order; and gave an appropriate “Greeting to the Club.” She spoke of the deepening colors, pleasant sunshine, and soft breezes of October, as being in keeping with the spirit of our re-union--after the interlude of the summer, suggesting the graver and deeper things of human life, as well as the warm interest we have in our common aims and efforts.

The Recording Secretary read the minutes of June 1st, which were adopted. The President read a letter from Miss McConkey, an honorary member, giving some interesting incidents of life on the Pacific Coast.

Announcement was made of the good work prepared for the coming year by our Committees.

The President then read an article--or as she called it--”A Talk;” in which she gave a comprehensive review of the general features and tendencies of the latest contemporary literature. She quoted largely and discriminatingly from authors, critics and well-known leaders of thought in literature. She gave us some striking quotations from James Lane Allen on the feminine and masculine elements in modern literature and art, suggesting the

[164]

contrast of the refinement, grace and smallness of the one, with the vigor, strength and magnitude of the other. In connection with novels and short stories, we were told that there is now no place in our literature for the author of bad prose, no entrance into the temple without the sacred use of language. The masculine element in English literature--going down to the basis of things--was brought before us; and the possibility of the union of the two principles of manhood and refinement, of grace and strength. Mrs. Turnbull made quotations from Professor Jebb, from Mr. Lecky, and others. She went on to speak of the fortieth anniversary of the “Atlantic Monthly,”--a Magazine which has kept to its ideas:--not striving for popular applause, nor seeking the aid of illustrations and advertisements but hold to the faith of its founders. She spoke of the articles in the magazine of the present month, with great interest;--especially quoting one, in which we are reminded of the want in our present day of supreme greatness giants in literature,--having many manikins speaking not from conviction, but just what it is good to say.

Our President also spoke of an article in the “Dial” on Literary Clubs, and on those who make literature more interesting and amusing than it has been, and on others who show it as a vital and eternal thing. A tribute was paid to Mr. [Richard Holt] Hutton, the late editor of the London Spectator, as leader of true literary journalism, disregarding sensationalism and personalities. He believed in seeking the companionship of great thoughts--great thoughts that must

[165]

be lived in and brooded over until they become a passion and a power for those who are dominated by them.

The next article of the programme was by Mrs. [Louise Clarkson] Whitelock, and was called: “The Making of the Book.” It was read by Mrs. [Aileen B. C.] Dammann. Mrs. Whitelock told of a shadowy land, where a being sits in judgement, holding three books, and before him pass continually a throng of those whose heart’s desire is to have their names inscribed by him in gold or silver, in blood or tears or ink. The first book is full--for the past;--the second is open for today. The judge hears the poets, the dreamers, the aspirants to deathless fame. There were in this article some fine tributes and characterizations given to the poets who have won the praise of men, or the love of the great heart of humanity, whose names the stern judge could not refuse to write for the past or the present. We were not told of the book of the future, and we seemed to hear the dirge of the rejected, who vanish, and leave only a thought--or a rhyme.

The next article of the programme was by Miss Ellen Duval[l], and was on “The Seven Seas” of Rudyard Kipling. It was read by Mrs. Morris. Miss Duvall spoke of the so-called poets’ poet and the people’s poet; and said that Kipling was one of those who appeal to universal popularity rather than to fame. To make such appeal the harp must be more resonant than melodious; the harper must be akin to the old bards,--have their nature feeling

[166]

and follow their rules. Their followers too must love their out of door living, their courage, faith and loyalty, and have no quarrel with life, but a cheerful acceptance of what life brings. He must be able to discover in the common place what is often its real characteristic, of romance; and to give us that which if not absolute poetry, is absolute nature. Kipling, it was said, draws for us the thing as he sees it, gives us his love of life as hie finds it. To each should be his gift, and its expression in his own way. Miss Duvall quoted some very fine stanzas from Mr. Kipling’s poems, pointing out in them what we cannot refuse to call the touch of genius. The President spoke of Mr. Kipling’s poem “Lest we Forget,” with high commendation.

The last article of the programme was” “Three Poems,” by Miss Lizette Woodworth Reese. The first was called “A Bookworm;” the second “The Apple Trees;” and the third, “The song of a Shepherd.” They were received with the appreciation always given to the poems of Miss Reese.

Congratulations on our re-union were followed by an informal adjournment.

**Meeting of October 12th, 1897.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, October 12th, 1897, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. The weather being inclement, the attendance was small. The President sent a letter excusing and regretting her absence, and asking that the officer present highest in rank should preside. Both Vice President [were absent] also, and the Treasurer not having

[167]

arrived,--after some delay--the Recording Secretary occupied the chair; read the minutes of October the 5th; and announced the articles of the programme.

The first article was by Mrs. George Dallas Dixon, and was called “The Dallas of that Ilk.” The Dallas of Dallas described to us by Mrs. Dixon was a very loveable admirable old lady whose mind and soul lived in the past--in the old Scotland of her ancestors, and their clansmen, through her mortal frame, and her grace and godliness adorned the Scotland of our contemporaries. She upheld and maintained the honor of her country, and the Free Church of Scotland with all the power and prestige--the glory and virtues of her forefathers,--the great Dallas family. She would relate how the decisive battle at Culloden was lost,--because one of her ancestral heroes did not command his clan there; he having yielded his rightful place at the demand of love, and a strained sense of honor. But she was not a Jacobite now; she was loyal to Queen Victoria, though not liking at all the memory of the Queen’s great great uncle “proud Cumberland.” We were told of the twilight of declining years, full of pleasant hallucinations, of old- world charms, and loving faith, until the ancestral tomb opened to receive this true Dallas of the Ilk.

The next article was by Mrs. Jordan [Ellen W.] Stabler, and was on “The Huguenots in America.” Mrs. Stabler said that as early as 1555, it had been the desire of Admiral Coligny, to plant colonies in America of those who shared his religious convictions. Also that

[168]

among the early visitors to this continent there were those who left traces of their presence in softening influence upon the aborigines, the Indians, who were heard to sing French hymns and to recount traditions of French origin. She spoke of the emigrations of Huguenots to Germany, Holland, and England; and from those countries to America,--to the West Indies and to the English Colonies. She mentioned many well-known families in New England, in New York and New Jersey, and still more in Virginia and South Carolina and even in our own city--whose names, often mispronounced;--as well as their records, show their descent from these emigrants. She quoted from an historian of Massachusetts, who spoke of the introduction by these people into New England of just those moral and mental qualities most needed by the society into which they came. Their French cheerfulness, and politeness, their tolerance in religion, firm trust and hopeful spirit, were, she told us a beneficial and healthful leaven among the elements that combined to form the New World.

The next article of the programme was “Some Original Poems,” by Mrs. Sidney [Clara B. Newman] Turner. Mrs. Turner spoke of having often waked up in the night with the sudden impulse to write; and after writing--having gone to sleep again. The first poem was a questioning about the realm of sleep,--for bird and for flower and man,--and lightly touching a note of mystery. There was one on what people are thinking about, and of the people who are not thinking at all, and of the boys who are thinking of the girls, and the girls who are thinking of the boys. We were

[169]

Reminded of the little children who have no fear of age, and told of reveries, of love and sorrow, and memories.

The programme had promised us an article by Miss Emma [Fenwick] Brent but it had been mislaid, and she asked to be excused.

The last exercise was “Recitations.” by Mrs. G. J. [Sarah J.] Wilmer. She gave us first the poet Longfellow’s “Sandalp[h]on, the Angel of Prayers.” The was followed by “King John and the Abbot of Canterbury;” and then “Brahma’s Paradise,” and the Man and Woman who died of being too good,--which were all appreciated.

After the announcement of the subjects appointed for the next Tuesday, the meeting adjourned.

Meeting of October 19th, 1897.

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, October 19th, 1897, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Mrs. [Aileen B. C.] Dammann, Chairman of the Committee on Current Criticism.

The President called the meeting to order; and the Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of October 12th. The President announced that the Corresponding Secretary of the Club, Miss [Anne Weston] Whitney, who had given us the benefit of her faithful services for the last year, had felt obliged to resign her position, owing to the pressure of other duties, making its retention impossible. The Board of Management had appointed our well-known member and friend, Mrs. [Maria W.] Miller, as Corresponding Secretary of the Club. The President also spoke of the

[170]

custom, which seems to have almost unavoidably grown upon us, of beginning our meetings later than half past three o’clock. She thought that, in future, it would be right to keep to the hour appointed, especially as the season grows later.

The President then spoke of the pictures lent to the Club by Mr. Zacharias. She also read the letter of Madame Blanc to the Corresponding Secretary, accepting honorary membership in the Club, and hoping to see at least some of us again in America--or in France.

Friendly communications were announced as having been received from the Century Club of Philadelphia, and from the Club of Wilmington, Delaware. Mention was made of the articles read to the Club, by our member, Miss [Anne Weston] Whitney, which have since been published.

The first article of the programme was “Book Notes,” by Miss Ellen Duvall. It was read for her by Mrs. [Aileen B. C.] Dammann. The first review was of the latest book of Edward Bellamy, called “Equality.” Miss Duvall considered it hard to characterize this book as a novel--an argument or as anything else. A child may call a set of lines on his slate “a cow,” when only a mother’s indulgent scrutiny can discover any resemblance to that familiar animal. Mr. Bellamy’s theories are advanced with evident sincerity, but they may be nevertheless false and dangerous. She spoke of his division of humanity into two classes, the very rich, and the very poor; leaving out the very large middle class who are neither,--who can pray Agar’s prayer, and to whom it seems to have been answered. She thought he left out Christianity as the one remedy for the evils he feels to be overwhelming. She reminded us of the

[171]

truth that “necessity is the mother of invention,” and dwelt on the lack of the impulse to invention or improvement, and even of the evolution of talent or genius in a dead level of equality. She thought such socialism lowering and not elevating; and that if it could prevail, it would be the worst form of tyranny ever devised.

We were told that Mrs. Alan Smith was personally acquainted with Mr. Bellamy, and would tell us something about him. Mrs. Smith said she was not a socialist, and had not read “Equality,” but she wished to say that Mr. Bellamy was quite a charming person, beloved at his home, and that he devoted his time and efforts to the good of his fellow men. She gave some instances of his unselfishness, among others, that of his having been invited to lecture in a Western city, and on receiving the inquiry as to what compensation he was to receive, of his answering: “Simply the railroad expenses.”

The President spoke of our being glad to hear what Mrs. Smith had told us--though we might think the theories of which we had just heard impracticable.

Mrs. Dammann then read Miss [Ellen] Duvall’s review of the new book of Hall Caine, called “The Christian.” The motive of this book she said, was not clear,--it seems to begin nowhere,--and to end not at all. It puts before us tragically, and with serious pessimism, only a false Christianity. The hero is one of the weakest of men. The heroine is a creature of contradictions who, though she knows three books,--the Bible

[172]

the Prayer Book and the Pilgrim’s Progress--and goes out to tea in a man’s dress,--is a sort of innocent, ideal Eve, before the event of the apple; an unknown being, not existing, if not an idiot. John Storm evolves the doctrine that he ought to kill the body to save the soul. He tries to carry out a sort of slavish imitation of Christ, which alone giveth life to the Christian.

Miss [Ellen] Duvall next reviewed the French book “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">En</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Route.</span>" It seemed the story of a seeker after life eternal who studied the externals of religion rather than its spiritual message.

The next article was by Mrs. Morris; and was on the works of Miss [Mary Eleanor] Wilkins. She told us that some short stories by this exponent of the strong, gloomy New England character, were read in translation to a cultivated French woman; who said immediately that “they could not be true, that such characters were impossible.” But we know that such people do live on New England’s rock-bound coast. Mrs. Morris gave an interesting critical review of the novel of “Jerome, A Poor Man.” The pride, and obstinacy, and true heroism, of the New England boy were revealed to us in a few incidents or reflections. The funeral of the father, who had simply disappeared, with mourners only to make it real, did seem impossible outside of New England. We see the limitations of New England, but we are conscious of upward progress, into the regions of elevated thought. Mrs. Morris went on to speak of the verses for children, written by Miss Wilkins.

[173]

as full of exquisite poetic feeling. She read two of these poems with much appreciation.

The last article of the programme was “Miscellaneous Notes,” by Mrs. Dammann. She spoke of the books she had read during the past summer, with discriminating criticism. She told us of the “Letters of a Parish Priest,” which has been pronounced a book recording a true life of noble deeds. She then spoke of some of the novels which are called and powerful, but which seem to appeal to the worst part of our human nature,--and to undermine our faith and hope and love.

After speaking of new biographies, Mrs. Dammann took up Mr. [Andrew] Lang’s “Pickle the Spy.” She said that the high-born Highland chief [Alastair Ruadh MacDonnell] here revealed to us, in the guise of a spy, reminds us of Thackeray’s Barry Lindon, but he is worse; even though his biographer asserts that he served England well, and that the prince, whom he betrayed, had become worthless.

Mrs. Dammann also spoke of a very modern book. “The Diary of an Englishman in Paris during the Terror.” She compared this book with one written about fifty years ago, Lamartine’s “History of the Girondists.” From this last she made quotations; one being the description of Marie Antionette and the King--one knew how to struggle, and the other to submit; but neither knew how to reign. She spoke of Malesherbes, the self-sacrificing defender of the King at his trial; who, when the royal prisoner reminded him that his carriage had been standing for hours in the cold air, gave answer that his driver had the heart of a good Frenchman, and that his horses shared his opinion.

The meeting adjourned.

[174]

**Salon of October 26th, 1897.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, October 26th, 1897, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This being a monthly salon, no programme was given. The President had written her regrets for not being present with us, and sent her greetings to the Club.

The Vice President, Mrs. Wrenshall, presided, and the minutes of the meeting of October 19th were read,--and adopted. After the announcement of the subject of the next meeting, Mrs. [Aileen B. C.] Dammann called attention to the lecture of Anthony Hope, soon to be given in our city.

Miss [Lizette Woodworth] Reese spoke of our custom of decorating the graves of the authors and artists of Maryland on All Soul’s Day, the 2nd of November. Notice was given of the Committee having this matter in charge; also of the time to send flowers for this purpose; and suggestions were kindly made by Mrs. Tait and Miss Grace.

It was announced that we had as our guest, Miss [Helena T.] Goessman from Amherst, who is now lecturing on History at Notre Dame. She was introduced by the presiding officer, and requested to favor us with a few words on the subject in which she was especially interested.

Miss Goessman said she had [not?] expected to do anything but listen this afternoon. She had only four weeks in this part of the country; and but little of the time out of the classroom. She had, however, been in literary Clubs in Boston and Worcester, and not very long ago, the guest of one in New Orleans. She spoke of the best work done by such societies. She then told of her having lately visited an invalid,

[175]

unable to sit up, who had gathered around her some fifteen or eighteen young girls; and was reading and studying with them Longfellow’s Evangeline. She said the selection they happened to be reading just then, was the description of Evangeline herself, after “the lesson that trial and sorrow had taught her[“] and of the “love diffused” that--

“like to some odorous spices, 
Suffered no waste nor loss, though  
Filling the air with aroma.”

Miss Goessman also spoke of the true and ennobling influence of literary associations.

The presiding officer then invited the members to come forward and meet Miss Goessman.

The rest of the afternoon was passed with pleasant conversation and refreshments.

**Meeting of November 2nd.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, November 2nd, 1897, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Mrs. George [Louise Clarkson] Whitelock, Chairman of the Committee on Fiction. The President called the meeting to order; and the Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of October 20th.

The President announced that the inclemency of the weather had, that morning prevented the Memorial Committee from going--according to our custom on All Soul’s Day--to decorate the graves of Maryland authors and artists,

[176]

but that they would take the flowers provided, and those sent to them, to their destinations on the following day. Among the tributes sent to us for this commemoration, was one from the “Daughter of the Revolution,”--for the grave of our late member, Mrs. Easter.

The President then read a poem by our honorary member, Mrs. Florence Earle Coates, and sent by her to the Club. It was an appreciative tribute to the Arctic explorer Hansen [Matthew Henson.]

The first article of the programme was a story called: “On the Sand Dunes,” by Mrs. George Dallas Dixon; and read by Mrs. [Louise Clarkson] Whitelock. The President read to us the Prospectus of the new Magazine “Literature,” to be published in England and America.

The second article of the programme was called “Kith and Kin,” and was an old Maryland sketch, by Mrs. C. W. [Alice Emma Sauerwein] Lord. She told us of a pair of young cousins in the Arcadian life of Southern Maryland, who seemed to have been preordained by fate to marry each other,--after the immemorial fashion of their “kith and kin.” And, despite the young girl’s ambitions, aspirations, and wandering fancy, Fate brings these agreeable young lovers in the end, to fulfill their destiny. They have too the half humorous, and all pleasing, episode of the union of two older lovers to keep them company; and we may feel that Fate was kind to them.

The Recording Secretary then read a letter to our President from Mrs. Susannah Phelps Gage, President of the “George Washington Memorial Association.” It told of the effort being now made to carry out the well-known

[177]

intention of the Father of our Country to found a National University in Washington,--and asked our interest in it.

The last article of the programme was “An Egyptian Story,” by Mrs. Yates Stirling. It told of the ancient civilization in which the idea of cast, reached so great and strange a development, that even among the embalmers of the dead, those who had charge of the upper part of the body, would not marry into, nor associate with the families of those who treated the lower part of it. But “stony limits cannot hold Love out,” says Shakespeare,--probably they never could do so. Mrs. Stirling painted the love of a fair maid of the lowest caste for one far above her, a priest’s son, who had recognized “her pathetic beauty,” and loved her too, despite iron-barred prejudice, and impregnable law. So, there on the Nile, on the Pharoah’s birthday, the lovers met, and in the young priest’s boat they passed down the sacred stream in innocent joy, until they reached the fatal rocks of the river,--and met, perhaps, a no more cruel fate than they would have endured if spared for longer life.

The President then spoke of Mrs. Stirling’s connection with our Archaeological Committee, and suggested that as the programme had been a short one, some of the members might be glad to ask questions on the subject last treated. Mrs. Stirling then answered some inquiries,--after which the meeting adjourned.

[178]

**Meeting of November 9th, 1897.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, November 9th, 1897, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Mrs. [Alice Emma Sauerwein] Lord, Chairman of the Committee on Essays and Essayists.

The President called the meeting to order; and the Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of November the 2nd. The President spoke of our Club Library which is of course for the use of our members, and contains a number of works written by Maryland women. She said those of our members who wish to enjoy any one of these books, for a week at a time, could give their names to our Librarian, Mrs. [Ariana Trail] Belt.

The first article of the programme was by Mrs. John M. [Maria W.] Miller, and was on Elizabeth Stuart Phelps. Mrs. Miller described this well-known writer, who was born in Boston, but went, when three years old, to live at Andover, her father being a Professor in the Theological College there; and we were shown how the Andover Theological and intellectual culture overshadowed--and enlightened the nature of this well-endowed New England woman. We were told of her first printed story which was published when she was thirteen years old,--after which literary success she put on high-necked dresses, and sat up till nine o’clock at night. Also of her singularly successful career as a writer; as she has had no manuscripts returned to her, except one; and that one after her fame was assured. Mrs. Miller told us much that was interesting about the life of Miss Phelps and about

[179]

her books, especially “The Gates Ajar,” “The old Maid’s Paradise,” and the late Autobiography. But we did not hear a great deal about Mr. Ward, the gentleman who has married Miss Phelps, and who styles himself “The Burglar who Moved Paradise.”

The next article of the programme was by Mrs. G. K. [Margaret Ann Worden] McGaw, and was called “Reflections upon the Writings of Robert Louis Stevenson.” Mrs. McGaw said that we find the life of Stevenson written in his books, and we do not separate him from their characters. She spoke of his capacity for friendship and affection. She thought his love of Nature and enjoyment of life were parts of his individual inheritance from his old Norse ancestors. He showed too, the native force of the old Covenanters, who shared the strength of the everlasting hills, and loved the heather beds. We were told of his sojourn in our own country, and of his making a friend of a little American girl, who sadly confided to him the fact that she had only had two birthdays in her life,--having been born on the 29th of February. He then drew up, in grave legal phraseology, a document conferring on her all his own birthdays,--the 13th of November.

Mrs. McGaw spoke of Stevenson’s “Treasure Island,” which Mr. Gladstone is said to have read at one sitting, and of his many other works. She quoted his descriptions of the wild scenes of Nature in different parts of the world, in which he took the fullest delight, and found the truths revealed to savages. Mrs. McGaw then quoted some lines from this lover of

[180]

the good and beautiful things of this world, showing the faith that sustained his soul in the near prospect of leaving them.

At the end of Mrs. McGaw’s article,--the President proposed that we should suspend the meeting to welcome our member, Mrs. [Lucy Randolph] Cautley, who had been long away from us, across the sea, which was done.

The last article of the programme was “An Essay,” by Mrs. Sidney [Clara B. Newman] Turner, and was called “Ships that Pass in the Day.” Mrs. Turner gave us some reminiscences of the late summer of 1897. She spoke of pleasant incidents on land and on water,--as of hearing the flute-like tones of the sweet singer, Calvé, and of seeing the statue of Ole Bull at Minneapolis, commemorating the music of other days. She was admitted into one lovely phase of New England life, where the daughters of the house could bake and brew, in their summer kitchen, in the most lady-like and graceful individualities, truly their own. She spoke of sleeping in the room where Emily Dickinson died, and going from the centers of New England culture to visit the highlands and the sea. She gave some half humorous criticism of the art of entertaining guests, not over--nor under--entertaining, but making your home and yourself the truest presentation of friendship.

Mrs. Turner spoke too of the finer art of giving sympathy to those we meet on our way through this world. She told in pathetic lines of the ships passed in the summer sea and of the coming back to the port of home.

The President then read to us an article sent to her by Miss [Mary Worthington] Milnor. It was

[181]

A Lecture on the writings of Sidney Lanier, by the Reverend Mr. Huckle of this city. It was a fine and appreciative criticism of the poems we know, and a fitting tribute to the poet who once lived among us, and gained our admiration and esteem. The meeting adjourned.

**Meeting of November 16th, 1897.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, November 16th, 1897, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Mrs. Jordan [Ellen W.] Stabler, Chairman of the Committee on Unfamiliar Records.

The President called the meeting to order; and the Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of November 9th.

The President called attention to the sample copies of the new monthly paper--”Baltimore Music,” edited by Miss May G. Evans, long a member of our Club and spoke of the good wishes with which its publication would be received among us.

The Recording Secretary then read to the Club a list and description of all the public lectures to be given by the Johns Hopkins University during the coming season.

The first article of the programmes was by Mrs. John D. [Maud Graham] Early, and was called “Two Servants of the Olden Times.” It was read for Mrs. Early by the Recording Secretary. Mrs. Early first told us of two native Africans, the ancestors of the servants known to her own childhood. This original couple lived honored and approved as good and pious Christians. But when old Jack died, Venus.

[182]

His widow, bade farewell to the white children she loved saying she was going to Africa to meet Jack, and then hung herself over his grave, on which she had placed eatables, and some small articles, probably symbols of the heathen faith of their fathers. Her descendant Jane, a family nurse, was not the old black “Mammy” known to song and story, but the result of a faithful African nature under Presbyterian training and examples. Though loyal always to “her white people” she once answered a weeping child, who was afraid she would never get to heaven: “Nobody ever said you would.” Her youthful charges being much elated because a visitor had called them “lovely” met the rebuff: “Tell her to stay awhile, and get used to your loveliness.” Her stoicism was recorded as shown on several occasions, and she never complained,--a remarkable thing certainly in one of her race.

Mrs. Early went on to describe her grandfather’s cook, who first appeared as Serena Parsnips,--an appellation she highly resented, and at the age of eighteen she was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church, as Maria Teresa Johnson. She was perfection as a cook, and had great success in raising flowers and birds, but her literary taste was very remarkable. Though she could never learn to read, she knew by heart much of the poetry and the novels of Sir Walter Scott, and she also delighted in the “Scottish Chiefs” and “The Children of the Abbey.” More modern novels did not please he, she liked “Dunallan” far better. Her favorite historical character was the Empress Maria Theresa. The devotion of both these old servants to “their white people” was

[183]

well-described, and Mrs. Early closed her article with the sacred words: “I call you not servants; I have called you friends.” Miss [Mary F.] Grace and others then gave interesting accounts of some “good and faithful servants,” who were highly appreciated by the families they served.

The next article of the programme was by Miss Maria Middleton, and was called: “An Old Southern Home.” It was illustrated by photographs of the old home, and of its attractive features. Miss Middleton opposed the idea of Nathaniel Hawthorne that old homes have a malign influence on those who live in them. She spoke of the true home feeling, and of the homes that are full of loving memories. She then described an old home in Charleston, South Carolina, as it was forty years ago,--in the beauty and glory of its <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ante</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">bellum</span>days. She told of its first building, and of the loves and heroism, the merry makings and sorrows that have brightened or shadowed or hallowed it, and of the histories domestic and public gathered around it. She described Mrs. Rebecca Motte, who was the mistress of this house during the Revolutionary War, and her memorable patriotism. She told the story of Fort Motte on the Congaree River. Here, we were told in an old history: “The British had built their works around Mrs. Motte’s country-dwelling house. She, with great cheerfulness furnished the Americans with materials for firing her own house. These being thrown by them on its roof soon kindled into flame. The firing of the house, which was in the center of the British works, compelled the garrison of one hundred and sixty-five men to surrender at discretion.”

Mrs. Motte’s beautiful house in Charleston

[184]

was occupied by armies in those days,--and in days much nearer our own. But the descendants of Rebecca Motte, who live there now, make the lovely flowers of their garden into bouquets, with the talent for selection and arrangement that no florist seems able to imitate; and so find the means to live with something of the grace and dignity of their ancestors.

The next article of the programme was by Mrs. Yates Stirling, and was called: “The Letters of Betty Lawrence.” It was a story of the Revolution, beginning in 1779. Betty Lawrence of Bordentown, New Jersey, a true American girl tells in letters to her cousin Lavinia, how a wounded British officer, Arthur De Lancey, was thrown upon her care by another cousin of her own. This latter was one of Washington’s soldiers, and to him the Englishman had done the inestimable service of liberating him from the Jersey prison ships. The letters tell how pity was akin to love, and how the course of true love led to a home in Devonshire, England, called Ragdon Hall, where the descendants of these true lovers in a true story still live to confirm the pleasant tale.

The last article of the programme was by Mrs. Jordan [Ellen W.] Stabler, and was called: “A Glimpse of the Channel Islands.” Mrs. Stabler showed us her photographs taken in the Channel Islands during a summer visit there a little more than a year ago. They represented curious old fortifications, Druidical remains and places known to history. We were shown the shores of Sark, the rocks and the long isthmus, and the gathering of sea weed, a valuable crop to the islanders, also views

[185]

of the mansion and estate of her host, a Scotchman, who chooses to live in Guernsey,--with its lovely flowers, and dwarf apple trees a hundred years old. We were shown the current coin of Guernsey, made in England for the use of the islanders, who she showed us, have their own laws, and to a great extent their own government. Mrs. Stabler referred to a report published sometime ago that England was about to cede the Channel Islands to France,--in return for a “free hand in Egypt.” But though seemingly having some support in the then recent cession of Heligoland to Germany, the rumor was a false one.

The people of the Channel Islands were, we were assured, loyal to Queen Victoria, as well they may be. They are exempted from the taxes and military service which would be required if they should join their fortunes to those of France, the nation whose language they still speak and with which they are allied by their Norman ancestry. But the people of these Islands claim that their ancestors annexed England, their homes having been part of the original domain of Willian the Conqueror. Mrs. Stabler took us with her over Jersey and Guernsey and Sark, bringing out the peculiarities and histories of the several islands and their people, and showing in all that old-world charm and fascination which Americans, many of them, appreciate and enjoy.

The meeting adjourned.

[186]

**Salon of November 23rd, 1897.**

The meeting of the Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, on November 23rd, 1897, was a Salon; and on this occasion some literary gentlemen were present by special invitations.

At half past four o’clock a fine Musical Programme was given by Mr. Edwin L. Turnbull, and Mr. Philip Ogden,--on the violin and piano. The selections were from Wagner, Mendelssohn Chopin and Liszt. Pleasant conversation contributed to the enjoyment of the afternoon.

**Meeting of November 30th, 1897.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, November 30th, 1897, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Miss Emma [Fenwick] Brent, Chairman of the Committee on the Exact Study of the English Language.

The President called the meeting to order, and the Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of November 16th. Announcement was made of the election of three new members into the Club.

The first article of the programme was by Miss Mary Grace; and was called “Heraldic Anomalies.” Miss Grace went back to the early days of heraldic devices, and gave us the grave and the gay, and the historical and symbolical aspects and attributes of heraldry. Among other anecdotes, she told us one of the wife of an apothecary, a knight who had received his title on the presentation of an address to the queen. This newly titled Englishwoman, on visiting

[187]

A summer resort, enrolled her name at the public library as Lady Mary B. thereby sending the other visitors to examine their “Peerages” to find out whether she was the daughter of a duke, marquis or earl. Her name was Mary, and a knight of course makes his wife a lady; but, we were reminded, he cannot make her a Christian, nor ennoble her Christian name. Among other anomalies, we were told of the singular origin or suggestions of the armorial bearings, mottoes, and other noble possessions of some great families. The article closed with a pedigree which apparently went back to antediluvian days, and came down to very modern ones, with no missing link nor omitted grace.

The next article of the programme was by Mrs. Alfred M. [Ariana Trail] Belt, and was called: “Glimpses into California Literature.” Mrs. Belt referred to life in California in the early days of the “gold fever,” and to the American Argonauts--as Bret Harte called them. She then spoke of the beginnings of journalism and of literature that in good time began to appear. She told of the establishment of the “Overland Monthly,” with Bret Harte as its editor, and chief contributor. She spoke of Joaquin Miller--and of Mark Twain, and of their works, personalities and influence. She also spoke of [Charles Warren] Stoddard, and Mrs. [Kate Douglas] Wiggan and Helen Hunt Jackson, and others whose writings have brought California near to us. As a fine piece of local color she read the poem called “Evening through the Golden Gate,” by Edward Pott. She read also a poem by John Ridge, the son of a Cherokee warrior, who could not get justice for his people, and who seemed to draw sad music from a harp with broken

[188] 

strings. Mrs. Belt went on to speak of the literary women of California, especially of Ina D. Cooley [?] and of Mrs. [Emelie Tracy Y. Swett] Parkhurst, and of the Woman’s Press Association of the Pacific Coast. She closed with some California poems that were highly appreciated.

The next article of the programme was by Miss Maria Middleton, and was called: “English in America.” Miss Middleton spoke of the variations that have arisen in the English language during the three hundred years since it was brought by our ancestors to this continent. There is a difference in intonation,--she heard in England a sonorous tenor, that has been ascribed partly to the effect of the different climates. She spoke of different pronunciations, even among people who are educated, as in the case of the past participle called been, and as we hear it, “bin,” or even “ben” and others. She read some curious extracts from old records of the Colonial times, in connection with others of the mother country,--the little difference showing that in written language as in government, the two countries were still one. The propriety of giving to any new word a long probation was suggested, especially as we talk in America at the same rapid rate in which all our progress is made. Our lack of repose, the use of superlatives, and monotony of intensity are evident in our spoken language, at least; and the use of slang does not discredit a person socially so much here as abroad. The reform, it was said, should come in the practice of good English, of exact truthfulness, and of the noble art of expression.

The next article of the programme was by Mrs. Thomas Morris, and was called: “A Stroll in Old London.” Mrs. Morris took us

[189]

in spirit to see some of the landmarks of the past in London. She told of Newgate Street, of Newgate prison and the Old Bailey; of Christ’s Hospital and of the Blue Coat School of Edward the Sixth, with its memories of Lamb and Coleridge and other old friends. She described the localities associated with the memories of Richard Whittington and his cat, and John Milton and John Bunyan, of Shakespeare and Sir Christopher Wren, foremost in architecture and the Drama. Mrs. Morris brought before us many of the old customs, stories and memories that old London still keeps alive.

The next article of the programme was by Miss Emma [Fenwick] Brent, and was called: “An Ancient M. D. [Maryland].” Miss Brent described the beauties of that part of our own state surrounding the city of Hagerstown,--the region of Pen Mar, and Blue Ridge Summit. She spoke of the early hunters and mountaineers, and of the German emigrants who made their homes in that region,--who loved Nature, and admired those majestic mountains. She described the celebrated Black Rock, and the excursions made to it by the young people of Long Ago. She related the story of Jonathan Hager, the first great landowner of that region, and told of other residents known to fame,--and told of the pleasant life in the picturesque old town.

She then gave an account of an old Dr.--Samuel Young, a Scotchman, who was always accustomed to appear in the short clothes and silk stockings of our ancestors, and who seemed to combine a whole college of Physicians and Surgeons in himself. Miss Brent

[190]

displayed his bill, in account with Capt. Jonathan Hager, begun in 1783, and running for eleven years, but every year reduced by the amount of the dotcor’s ground rents, as they came due, and payable to the said Captain Hager,--until in 1794, the balance of £17. 16 s. 7 d. made a settlement in full. The most frequently recurring item was 12 s. 6 d. for anti-hysterical drops furnished for the sister-in-law, who was apparently, the invalid of the family. But a servant boy was soon promoted to the dignity of having anti-hysterical drops prescribed for him also. The doctor’s skill in writing and spelling was--it seems--far inferior to that which he applied to the diseases he announced himself as “farfected to cure.”

After conversation, the meeting adjourned.

**Meeting of December 7th 1897.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore met on Tuesday, December 7th, 1897, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Miss [Mary F.] Grace, Chairman of the Committee on Translation.

The President called the meeting to order, and the Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of November 30th. The President read a letter from Mrs. Croly,--Jennie June,--asking for information with regard to the Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore,--its aims and work; as she wishes to give some account of it in her Year Book of Clubs about to be published.

It was announced that by the kindness of

[191]

Mrs. Goucher, tickets had been sent to our members, for the two lectures to be given before the students of the Woman’s College, by Mrs. Daniel Dorchester.

The first article given from the programme was by Mrs. T. I. Morris, and was called: “My First Doll.” It was from the French of Madame Michelet. Mrs. Morris spoke of Madame Michelet’s “Recollections,” in which she gives an unaffected picture of child life, with an exquisite grace almost impossible to render into English. We were given Madame Michelet’s Introduction to her book,--dedicating it to her husband.

In the story of The First Doll, the child’s day began with the prayer led by her father with uncovered head, and was passed chiefly in the fields, by the waters, and among the flowers and birds, with “Nature” that “never did betray the heart that loved her.” Through the devotion to her father we see that she had an unsympathetic mother, and brothers and elder sister. She had her cat, but she wanted a doll; and thought only of making one, ‘till the thought grew to action, and the doll was evolved from pads of cotton and cotton covering. Then it was breathed upon to give it the breath of life, and was alive and lovely to its little mother, though quite unappreciated by those whom she calls its grandparents, aunts and uncles. Then came the story of the first bought doll, its acquisition being the result of a sudden fit of courage and silent self-assertion,--which did not last long enough to gain also the doll’s proper vestments and adornments. It was all told with the half humorous and quite pathetic charm of those recollections that “lie deeper in the heart than the memories of joy.”

The next article of the programme was by

[192]

Miss Middleton, and consisted of translations of a “Sonnet from Dante,” and “Verses from Victor Hugo.” Dante’s Sonnet was “On Love,”--”the love by which our spirits live.” The first selection from Victor Hugo was “On Morning,”--on the early dawn that foretells the more glorious morning of Eternity. The second one was “Her Name,”--the name of the one best beloved. Miss Middleton said that a translation was like a photograph and could not give us the spirit that we recognize in the original,--but she succeeded in giving us true and beautiful poems.

The last article of the programme was given by Miss Mary Grace, and was called: “The Stranger,” a story by Catulle Mendez [Mendès]. It told of a village theatre--in a barn--where Sara Bernhardt had come to delight the shepherds there for the first time as she had elsewhere many times delighted princes. But a young girl comes--almost at the last moment--with the astonishing petition to be allowed to take the place of the great artist--and does take her place with such brilliant success that the substitution is not perceived. Then the successful novice in art, firmly declines the offers of the great artist to lead her on to fame and fortune; and insists on going back to be the gentle nurse of a sick father and brother, with the prospect of marrying a true lover of her own class, whom she loves also. Only, now, she is quite satisfied that her strong impulse for dramatic action was a sane and legitimate one. The question was suggested as a psychological study: “Was her refusal right? Or wrong?” Sara Bernhardt said “Wrong,” and we may agree or disagree--with her.

After some interesting comments, the meeting adjourned.

[193]

**Meeting of December 14th 1897.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, December 14th, 1897, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Mrs. Carter, Chairman of the Committee on Philanthropy. In the absence of the President, the meeting was called to order by the First Vice President, Mrs. Wrenshall. The Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of December 7th.

The announcement was made of the approaching assembling of the National Folk-Lore Society in Baltimore. Their meetings are to be held in Donovan Hall, Johns Hopkins University on the 28th and 29th of December; and to these meetings the members of the Club and their friends are invited. Announcement was made that the members of the Folk Lore Convention had been invited to be our guest on the evening of Tuesday, December 28th; that being the day for our monthly Salon, which will be omitted,--the reception of the evening taking its place; when the members of the Woman’s Literary Club and their escorts would have the pleasure of meeting the Folk-Lore Society.

The first article given from the programme was by Mrs. Thomas [Harriet Louise Wescott] Hill, and was called: “Philanthropy, its History and Methods. Historical Data of Some Home Charities.” Mrs. Hill reminded us of the old truism, “Charity begins at home;” but went on to speak of the broad activities, and advancing efforts for the good of humanity, which may seem to have their beginning among the loving sympathies of home, but not their end there--nor elsewhere. She thought it well to look backward over

[194]

some of the charitable foundations very near our homes. She spoke of the Hannah More Academy for girls, founded in 1832 by a legacy from Mrs. [Anne Van Bibber] Neilson,--whose good and religious work since that time is well known and appreciated. She told of the Mt. Hope Retreat for the Insane, its history, situation and environment, and described the pious devotion of the Sisters of Charity whose care and labors have given the sad but beautiful institution reputation. She next spoke of the Shepherd Asylum for the Insane, of its large endowments by its founder, Mr. Moses Shepherd, its wide purposes, and great power for good work. She spoke also of St. Paul’s Episcopal Orphan Asylum, founded in the last century, and continuing its successful labors. Of the Orphan Asylum of the St. Peter’s Episcopal Church, Mrs. Hill gave some interesting particulars. She spoke of its work having been brought to the notice of the Swedish Nightingale, Jennie Lind, when she was in this city,--by some one connected with the management of Barnum’s Hotel; and of the large donation of the great singer to St. Peter’s Asylum. While this queen of song was here, she was, we were told, made acquainted with the fact that a countryman of her own, was living in Chestertown, Maryland, a quiet old gentleman who was nevertheless an exiled member of the old royal family of Sweden,--the Vasas,--banished to give place to Marshall Bernadotte. Jennie Lind, we were told was delighted to meet the old Captain, sang for him repeatedly in private, and gave him and his family free tickets for singing in public.

Mrs. Hill spoke also of the well-known

[195]

Boy’s Home;--and closed with some general remarks on some other home charities whose influence extends beyond our home limits.

The next article was by Mrs. R. M. [Elizabeth J.] Wylie, and was called: “A Few Thoughts on True Philanthropy.” Mrs. Wylie said that her title would seem to imply that there is a false philanthropy, actuated by sentiment rather than reason,--which would give to a murderer the sympathy more justly belonging to his victim. This is shown perhaps in the East Indian story of the great Buddha’s having, in one Incarnation, given himself to a tigress to feed her starving cubs,--an example it has been said--which, if followed, would result in the filling up of the world with fat tigers.

Mrs. Wylie spoke of an old woman in New York, whose numerous descendants were inmates of so many penitentiaries and jails, that she is known as the mother of criminals. We were reminded of the excellence of prevention rather than cure in benevolent work. She then spoke of Florence Nightingale, of Clara Barton, of Miss Elizabeth Fry, and of the work of some devoted women of our time in the slums of great cities. She told of the little child who came to Christ’s Hospital and asked: “Is Christ at home?”--to which, a nurse, in equal good faith answered: “Yes, Come in.” She reminded us of the statue of the Divine Healer, placed in the Johns Hopkins Hospital, where it meets not only the physical, but the mental and moral vision of those who come to be healed. She spoke of the work of taking the poor out of their malaria haunted homes into purer air and surroundings, and she quoted the poem of Sidney Lanier: “Into the Woods, My Master went.” She closed with the

[196]

last page of our old--never too old--favorite Dicken’s Christmas Carol, with its Christmas blessing that we could all echo.

The last article given from the programme was by Mrs. R. K. [Lucy Randolph] Cautley, and was on “The Misericordia of Florence.” Mrs. Cautley took us back to the middle ages, when the dubious evasion: “Who is my neighbor?” seemed still generally considered an open question; and there was great need of the Brothers of Mercy to give in action the Divine answer. Shakespeare, she said, did speak of mercy in words for all time,--but then, he was Shakespeare. She quoted the recommendation of supposed remedies for diseases, requiring the most repulsive cruelty to animals, from the writings of Francis Bacon; and added: “There is nothing of this in Shakespeare.” Great painters of those days seemed fond of depicting the most dreadful tortures. Mrs. Cautley went back to the year 1240, and recounted the origin and history of the Misericordia of Florence, who went about doing good in disguise; and who do so still. The society has always included men of all ranks, grades and professions--the nobleman and the workman may, side by side, carry the sick to the hospital; bring the last consolation to the dying, or bury the dead. When the bell summons them to go in holy procession, they do not refuse their work. She told of their tower built in 1300, and of much of the work they have done. It is generally done silently,--the only comment being: “May God reward you.” Their masks and black cloaks are all alike,--but it was once suggested to her to “look at their boots, for differences. They are often called after fatal accidents,--though the Italian for accident, is not used as the English word is with us, a

[197]

remembrance perhaps of the times when wounds and injuries were less apt to be accidental than now.

As an interlude, Mrs. Cautley told the Florentine story of that Ginevra, who was legally dead and buried, to her parents and husband; but who still lived, and at last married her old true love. After a very picturesque description of the Misericordia of Florence, as we see them to day,--Mrs. Cautley reminded us that while the beauty and glory of the brilliant years of Florence have passed away, this one germ of good has outlasted the decay of the centuries.

The meeting then adjourned.

**Meeting of December 21st, 1897.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, December 21st, 1897, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. In the much-regretted absence of the President, the meeting was called to order by the First Vice President, Mrs. Wrenshall.

Announcement was made of the reopening of the Educational Class in English Literature conducted by Miss Ellen Duvall,--and held at the residence of Mrs. John D. [Maud Graham] Early. The presiding officer repeated the notice of the American Folk Lore Society at the Johns Hopkins University; and also the notice of the Reception to be given to that society by the Woman’s Literary Club on Tuesday evening December 28th, which would take the place of our afternoon social meeting.

The first article of the programme was

[198]

given by Mrs. John R. [Anna Dolores Tiernan] Tait and was called: “Leaves from my Bavarian Note Book.” Mrs. Tait described her having bidden farewell to Munich at a time when an unbidden guest--the Asiatic Cholera was driving residents and visitors away from that city, and when the hand of the great statue of Bavaria seemed to be uplifted in warning as she passed it on her way to the pure air of the mountains. She described the uncomfortable and the pleasant stopping places of her journey, but went on to tell of old fortresses, mountain scenery and villages, salt works and people as picturesque, or at least as entertaining as their environment; and telling us too of the legends, manners and customs of former times which have survived charm our modern eyes to the present day.

The next article from the programme was by Miss Lilian Giffen, and was called: “Japan: The Land of the Rising Sun.” Miss Giffen spoke of the Orient, for ages little known to western nations; and still the region of strange modes of life--from our point of view. She told of her thirteen days voyage across the Pacific Ocean, and of her arrival at Yokohama, the port of Tokyo. She described the harbor, with its varying pictures, the little boats, the landings, the people, and the national vehicle “the jinrikisha,”--drawn by the human horses,--to whom she was soon so much accustomed that she found the sound of hoofs and the sight of harnessed animals becoming strange to her. She told of the number of children seen everywhere, almost every woman having a child on her back, and apparently not being incommoded by it in her daily labor,--even a child of ten years would

[199]

have a baby to carry. She saw the married women with their eyebrows shaved off and their teeth blackened, it is said to prevent jealousy, but whether such disfigurement is an effectual prevention is not certain. Miss Giffen gave vivid descriptions of the picturesque scenery and beautiful flowers of Japan; and described her excursion to the sacred mountain, Fushi[Fuji]-yama--an extinct volcano, passing by the way gardens, tea-houses and solemn ancient temples with their great statues and idols. The girls at the tea-houses and elsewhere are small and very pretty, with black hair and delicate faces, but with expressionless eyes, and she felt that she was as strange to them as they were to her. Their dancing is only posing and their music is discord to us, though they laugh at our music and at what they think its want of harmony. In seeing the little doll-like women going through their parts,--one might take them for automata, and wonder how soon the machinery would run down.

Miss Giffen told of the savage grandeur of the great mountain and the rocks around it and of the loveliness of sea and sky. She told of the modern Tokio [Tokyo] and the old Jeddo [Edo], with its armed warriors and picturesque nobles. She spoke of fine ancient Japanese costumes which have been bought and carried away to Europe as valuable curiosities. We were told of a dinner in Tokyo, where one sat on the floor, and ate with chop sticks, where the confections were works of art, but with all the dishes, there was a dread of the unknown, which seemed to make a return to perfectly understood and familiar viands

[200]

A necessary afterpiece when the dinner was over. The hotels were found excellent, and Japanese servants excellent also. Miss Giffen spoke of the differences between the Buddhist worship and that of the more ancient Shintu [Shinto] faith. The Shintu [Shinto] shrines have not the idols of the Buddhist ones. She spoke of visiting one of the temples where everyone was obliged to endure the inconvenience of leaving the shoes outside. But once inside she forgot all else in the grand and gorgeous interior, the incense and the service with the solemnly toned bells by which she was surrounded. She told the tombs of the Shoguns and of the beautiful paths that led to them. She closed with a description of the lovely sunlight shining over the mountain and the sea, as she bade farewell to the Land of the Rising Sun.

At the close of Miss Giffen’s article it was announced that the story of Miss [Lizette Woodworth] Reese promised by the programme would not be given on that afternoon. The meeting then adjourned.

**Reception of Tuesday evening December 28th, 1897.**

There was no afternoon meeting of the Woman’s Literary Club on December 28th, 1897; but on the evening of that date the Club entertained the American Folk Lore Society, and a number of invited guests, literary and scientific ladies and gentlemen. There was much regret that our President was not well enough to be present, and that the First Vice President was also absent by reason of a family affliction. The company was however received by the Second Vice President, Mrs. Carter, and a Committee appointed by the Board of Management. A very pleasant evening was spent, refreshments were served, the spirit of the season added to the pleasure of the occasion.

[201]

**Meeting of January 4th, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, January 4th, 1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. In the absence of the President, and of the First Vice President, the Treasurer, Mrs. [Aileen B. C.] Dammann, by request called the meeting to order, and presided. A note from our President, Mrs. Turnbull, was read regretting her absence, and expressing her hope to be with us at the next meeting; and giving her Christmas and New Year’s greeting to all the members of the Club.

The first article of the programme was by Miss Ellen Duvall. She gave a Shakespearean Criticism, taking for her subject the play of The Tempest. She spoke of the imaginative character of this play. She compared and contrasted The Tempest with Hamlet. Hamlet, she said, appeals to the Hamlet in all of us; and we see the end from the beginning. She spoke too, of the old Greek plays, especially of the Medea of Euripides; and pointed out that in The Tempest, Shakespeare has really preserved the three classic dramatic unities of time, place and action. Miss Duvall paid particular attention to the plot, and still more to the characters of the play, especially of course to Prospero and Ariel. She then took up Shakespear[e]’s treatment of Witches, Fairies and Ghosts, and the question: How far did Shakespear[e] believe in them,--or in any of them? She did not credit him with the blind superstition of his age,--or of any age; but seemed to admit, with Ruskin,--that “Shakespeare’s sight was that of the sixteenth century, beneath all the broad and eternal

[202]

humanity of his imagination.” Miss Duvall dwelt especially on the ideas as shown by Prospero and Ariel, of Shakespeare’s treatment of magic, not as the low conjuror’s artifice, but as a benificent [beneficent] remedial force, used for the good of humanity. Perhaps we could, in more than one sense agree with Dryden, that--

“Shakespeare’s magic could not copied be:  
Within that circle none durst walk but he.”

At the close of Miss Duvall’s fine criticism, suggestive comments were made by Miss Brent and others.

The programme next announced “A Poem, on Jean Ingelow,” by Mrs. C. W. [Alice Emma Sauerwein] Lord. It was a loving tribute to “a girlhood’s guide,” whose “pole star was Love,” and who was very dear to many readers.

The next article of the programme was by Mrs. Percy [Elizabeth McCormick] Reese, and was called” “Race House.” It was a tale of a mystery, which only a deeper mystery had solved; told by an actor in the strange life drama of love and death, which is made manifest only in being made darker by madness.

The next article of the programme was by Miss Lizette [Woodworth] Reese, and was a story called: “Resolute Will.” We have been told that “when a woman wills, she will; you may depend on it.” The old Mrs. Rich of this story knew how to wait, and did not know how to be defeated in her undaunted purpose to make her son marry the woman of her choice for him--in spite of himself. Miss Reese told the story with much humor and spirit; and if Serena, who long “felt as if she had lost what had never been hers,” does marry Job at last, we can bow with both of them before a mother of such a resolute will. After pleasant comments, the meeting adjourned.

[203]

**Meeting of January 11th, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, January 11th, 1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Miss Lizette [Woodworth] Reese, Chairman of the Committee on Poetry.

The President being in the chair, was warmly greeted by the members of the Club, and gave her greeting to all in return. The Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of January 4th.

The first article of the programme was by Miss Middleton, and was called: “One Branch of Mediaeval Poetry.” Miss Middleton spoke of the hymns that are sung in modern Churches, many of them of no great poetic merit, and then dwelt especially on the sacred poetry that has come down to us from ancient and mediaeval times. She spoke of the ascriptions of praise by the Apostles and their followers as recorded in the fourth chapter of the book of Acts;--and of earlier and later Psalms and Hymns. She referred to the Hymns of the ages, and to those translated by Dr. John Mason Neale;--to their essential poetical qualities, and to the faith and love that illumines them. She quoted the very ancient hymn of St. Anatolius; and read also the evening hymn of another Anatolius;--Patriarch of Constantinople--in the fifth century--that is still to be heard, sung by the islanders of the Greek Archipelago. She told too of the old hymns that still greet us every Easter morning in the Cathedral o of Athens, with the joy of the resurrection. Coming down to the eighth century she spoke of the writings of St. John of Damascus, and then reminded us of the hymns ascribed to Kings, to Charlemagne,

[204] 

to King Robert of France and others. She dwelt on the well-known Dies Irae, and the other noble Latin hymns that come with it in our memories. She spoke of St. Bernard of Clairvaux, standing before Kings, preaching a crusade, combatting errors, and adding to the world’s treasury of sacred literature; and also of St. Bernard of Cluny whose great poem of sorrow and warning is yet bright with the beatific vision of “Jerusalem the Golden.” Miss Middleton also spoke of St. Francis Xavier, “the apostle of the Indies,” whose beautiful hymn is another proof that poetic utterance may be the native speech of the world’s great workers.

The next article of the programme was two poems by Miss Virginia [Woodward] Cloud. The first,--published in The Bookman, was read by Miss [Ellen] Duvall and was called: “Let me Believe,”--the second, read by Mrs. [Lucy Randolph] Cautley, was called “Up Stairs.”

The next article was by Mrs. Cautley, and was called “Some Finnish Poetry.” Mrs. Cautley spoke of Finland--the far northern country of which we hear but little--as a land of civilization, and good roads, of intelligent people, who still practice the virtues, insisted upon in their ancient poetry, of cleanliness and good housewifery. They have a University, they read translations of Shakespeare and Scott and other and later writers, and a recent traveller [traveler] speaks of having seen The Heavenly Twins on a Finnish book stall. But they have an ancient literature, beginning with runes and myths, and songs sung to the sound of the harp. They have one complete ancient poem, the Kalevala, which Max Muller called “the fifth epic of the world.” Mrs. Cautley told of the publication of the Kalevala

[205]

in 1835, and of its introduction to the rest of the world in 1849. It is written in eight syllable verse,--the metre [meter] of Hiawatha. Longfellow is said to have studied the Kalevala and, we were told, that if we read the ancient poem, we may think that the modern poet has imitated more than the metre [meter]. Mrs. Cautley then gave quotations from the Kalevala, some queer artlessly humorous stories about good and bad spirits,--on the origin of iron, and of the man who could not find a girl willing to marry him. There was also an account of a wedding, and of the highly characteristic advice given to the young couple by their relations and friends--one wise old woman telling the young man never to give his wife cause to regret her wedding. One advice was never to strike his wife in public.

Mrs. Cautley read of much that belongs to all time--to our own, as well as to three thousand years ago,--and showed us clearly that in the literature of even so young a people,--we could find recorded virtues worthy of our imitation, and add to our own stores of humility and reverence.

The next article of the programme was Two Poems, by Miss Lizette [Woodworth] Reese, “The Narcissus,” and “The Cherry Trees.” The last article was by Miss Ellen Duvall, and was on “Jean Ingelow.” Miss Duvall spoke of the indefinable nature of poetry; and of two classes of poets;--first of those who know most, and then of those who love most,--or have in the head that which was first in the heart. She spoke of the genius and of the emotional nature of many women poets, from Sappho to Elizabeth Browning. Among minor poets she placed Jean Ingelow. She sang for

[206]

the love of song, the emotion, and the sense of form, and if she gave us echoes, they were clear and melodious ones. For one great poet, we can have twenty Adelaide Procters,--or Jean Ingelows. But their writing is feminine, that of the English gentlewoman, a true and beautiful type of humanity. Miss Duvall drew a critical contrast between the treatment of a classic story by Jean Ingelow and by Algernon Swinburne. Jean Ingelow was true to the old tradition of her sex,--to be inferior to man,--to take the second place, strong to do all things for the one she loves,--the tradition we think not proclaimed by the Christ, who gave woman the same individuality as man.

After speaking of the poems of Emily Bronte, Miss Duvall noticed the strength and grace of Jean Ingelow, as shown in the poem--”High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire,” and the chief credit for depth of thought to one sonnet called Failure, comparing it with Emily Dickinson’s poem, Success. The same idea of success that is not the truest success, and of failure that is not real failure only to dim and limited vision,--was we were reminded suggested in Browning’s Fra Lippo Lippi, and his Andrea del Sarto; and the curve which really rises seems after all to be the spiral, slowly but surely uplifting us.

At the close of her essay. Miss Duvall read to us the two sonnets of Jean Ingelow. “Failure,” and “Wishing.” The meeting adjourned.

[207]

**Meeting of January 18th, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, January 18th, 1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Mrs. Jordan [Ellen W.] Stabler, Chairman of the Committee on Unfamiliar Records.

The President called the meeting to order; and the Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of January 11th.

The first article of the programme was given by Miss Mary D. [Dorsey] Davis, and was called: “A Study of Our State Seal.” Miss Davis told us of the history of the Great Seal of Maryland. She referred to her drawing of the seal of the Colony of Maryland, made from broken seals attached to land patents that had reached her by inheritance. These old seals were shown to us; and also the finished drawing made from them. After the success of our struggle for independence, she said, Maryland discarded the old seal, representing Lord Baltimore’s coat of arms, and adopted the figure of Justice as her emblem. A century later, when old wounds were healed, and honorable memories revived, the State authorities decided to return to the seal of Lord Baltimore. It had known vicissitudes in Colonial days. In 1644, the great seal was carried off during the Insurrection of Richard Ingle, and never recovered. In 1648, Lord Baltimore sent a new seal to the province, by the hands of Governor William Stone. After the rule of Cromwell it was necessary to send over a third seal by the hands of Captain Josias Fendall, which was in use from 1658 to 1793.

Miss Davis went on to tell us that in repairing the Treasury vaults at Annapolis in 1884,

[208]

the silver dies of the old seals were discovered, where an old window had been walled up; and there too was the portrait of a lady of name and fate unknown. She quoted Lord Baltimore’s description of the seal, and of his armorial bearings--suggesting royal and crusading descent, and provincial authority; also the inscription from the fifth Psalm: “With favor wilt Thou crown us as with a shield.” She spoke too of the ancestral motto on the scroll, the familiar “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fatti</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Maschii,</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parole</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Femine.”</span>--suggesting courage and courtesy. She went back to the origin and signification of seals from those mentioned in the Bible onward, and of other pledges and symbols--their history and their place in history.

In closing Miss Davis reminded us that although our seal has no longer the mounted figure of the mailed knight, it keeps the shield with armorial bearings, supported by the ploughman and fisherman; that though the days of chivalry, or at least knight errantry, have passed away, we can still emulate the true knightly virtues, and feel sure the “favor will encompass us as with a shield.”

The next article was by Miss Emma F. [Fenwick] Brent. She gave us “Some Recollections of Old Maryland and Baltimore.” She spoke of the old home and the tomb of General Samuel Ringgold, and of his daughter, who married John Key, a son of the author of the “Star-Spangled Banner.” She told of this old landed proprietor who could sell off one thousand acres of land at a time to pay off his debts. She told of some historical residences in our own city from Charles and St. Paul Streets to Broadway--and of the old Quaker settlement

[209]

in and around Lombard Street. The Howard residence with its grounds and fine old trees adjoined the Washington Monument. She reminded us of the watchmen who cried the hours at might in long drawn tones; who had their little round boxes in the streets, looking not very much taller nor broader than some of the watchmen themselves. But when we saw them half-open there was a light and a very little stove inside. She told of the volunteer fire companies, such as the New Market and the Monumental, and the uproars and fights when they and their partizans [partisans] tore through the streets to and from the fires. She spoke of the Cathedral as it was in those days, and the lovely singing she had heard there;--also of old St. Paul’s Church of the tower and bell, which was burned down. She spoke too of the first Holliday Street Theatre, also burned down; of the Museum where dramatic performances were given, and of the old Front Street Theatre, where Jenny Lind sang--because it was so large. She told of the three old shot towers, seen far and near; two at least of which have been taken down, as no longer necessary.

She then went on to the War, our own sad war, and to the changes it brought to Baltimore. But some of the old houses remain to remind us of the past. She spoke of the homes of the Hoffman family, which were said to have been all on the corners of streets. And one of these, after having been long the home of the Maryland Club, is now the building in which we hold our meetings.

The next article of the programme was by Miss Maria Middleton, and was called “Mistress Rebecca Motte.” The name recalled

[210]

to us Miss Middleton’s interesting article given to us on November 16th, 1897, describing the Old Southern Home of Mrs. Motte. One of her homes during the Revolution was, as we could remember--set on fire, with her cheerful consent, in order to dislodge the enemies of her country, who had occupied it. Miss Middleton took us back to Colonial times, and to the life of more than a century ago in the city of Charleston, South Carolina, and its surrounding region. She told of the girl, born in 1738, of French and English blood, growing up, fair and gentle, intelligent and dignified;--then married, and the mother of daughters;--the gracious hostess, mistress and friend. In the Revolution she was the true patriot always, but never losing her fine native dignity and grace, even when her home was invaded by British officers, who asked leave to kill her chickens, though apparently not so scrupulous with regard to appropriating her horses. We were given the deeds of daring and danger, and even the humorous side of life during the Revolution. Miss Middleton closed with a beautiful picture of life after the war, and of a serene and lovely old age in the old Southern Home which is still occupied by the descendants of the honored Mrs. Rebecca Motte.

The next article of the programme was by Mrs. Jordan [Ellen W.] Stabler, and was: “A Few Reminiscences of early days in Massachusetts and Maryland.” They were those of an appreciative observer. She began with the recollections of a boy at a school taught by a true teacher, far back in “the twenties.” He spoke of coming from New York to Baltimore when it took nearly a week to make the journey. He

[211]

described the Academy at Wrentham, Massachusetts, where corporal punishment was not allowed, but a split quill on the nose, or holding a nail, on the floor were its substitutes. Recollections of distinguished men were given. A story was told of Dr. Howe of Boston, who being asked why so temperate a man as himself should have the gout so badly, answered, that his ancestors drank wine, and that he had to foot their bill.

Mrs. Stabler told of her father’s having come back to Baltimore in 1828, and, at the age of thirteen, having been sent to a boarding school at Belair, where some since well-known Marylanders were then being educated, among others the late well-known educator, Dr. Dalrymple. At this school the discipline was extremely severe. The boys were allowed to walk some distance to church, and it was said that when peaches or persimmons were ripe they generally chose to go. These recollections gave a vivid description of the great “Bank riot” in Baltimore, some sixty years ago; a tradition of intense interest to the early years of some few of us, whose parents lived through that terrible time. They told us of the Sunday when the residences of very prominent citizens were torn to pieces, their furniture and works of art thrown into bon fires in the streets; and from Saturday to Monday there was a Mob rule; which ended as suddenly as it began. This story of an eyewitness is a contribution to the history of our city. Mrs. Stabler closed with a graceful poetical tribute to the writer of these recollections written by a distinguished professor of Yale College.

The meeting adjourned.

[212]

**Meeting of January 25th, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, January 25th, 1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets, for its January Salon. A programme had been prepared for this meeting by our Committee on Music, under the direction of Miss Jane Zacharias, Chairman.

The President called the meeting to order. She announced that Miss May Evans, one of our members, had sent to the members of the Club tickets for a concert to be given by the Peabody Graduates School of Music. Announcement and explanations were made of the subject of the next meeting on February first.

The first article of the programme was “The First Nocturne,”--poem by Miss Jane Zacharias. Miss Zacharias spoke first of the term “Nocturne,” used for a musical composition, for a religious office,--and with other meanings and applications. She spoke also of some former and contemporary events in the musical world. Her poem told of the nocturnal hymn of praise by the angelic host on the plain of Bethlehem. We then had the pleasure of hearing a song by Adolph Adam, sung by Miss Mary Carrington Brown.

The next article of the programme was an essay by Miss Annie Weston Whitney, and was on “Folk Song.” Miss Whitney spoke of “Folk Song” and “Folk Lore” in their relations to music and literature. She spoke of the idea of the Nocturne as exemplified in the ancient songs of the Hindoos [Hindus], as some of their songs were to be sung only in the day, and some only in the night, being so pleasing to the gods who preside over the light and the

[213]

darkness. Of one magical singer it is recoded that when he sang, a night-song at noonday, it instantly became midnight, and continued so for all within the sound of his voice, so long as he sang. She said, that folk lore deals chiefly with man’s life, but folk song with all pertaining to death,--the one tells most of fairies, and the other of ghosts. She read several old folk songs, illustrating the ancient superstitions and early poetic utterances of different races and nations. She also exhibited and explained a very curious piece of real picture writing--the representation of one of the songs of our own American Indian tribes. To understand it, she suggested our trying to imagine an illustrated song in one of our magazines, with the literal text omitted. As Miss [Anne Weston] Whitney translated it to us, it was a graphic description of the initiation of a pupil into the mysteries of the Indian medicine men, with striking figures of animals, and significant symbols of the incantations of these children of the forests.

Miss Mary Carrington Brown then gave us four songs of Rubinstein, and one of Tschaikowski, which were highly appreciated and enjoyed.

The next article of the programme was by Mrs. Asger Hamerik, and was on “The Russian School of Music, with Piano Illustrations.” Mrs. Hamerik said that her essay was written from information received by herself from St. Petersburg. She said that in former centuries there was no national music of the Russians, though there was always talent and force among them, that was not

[214]

allowed full play. The music of any nation begins with its folk songs and its religious chants and hymns. After the introduction of Christianity, in the form of the Greek Church, the Russians adopted the Greek chants,--still to be heard in their churches. Mrs. Hamerik spoke of the Czar Alexis the first, and of Peter the first as patrons of music, also of Alexis the second, who brought skilled musicians to St. Petersburg. She told of the custom of the great princes to have formed for them trained quartettes, bands or even orchestras among their serfs who performed German compositions, or even Italian operas. In the present century there has been a movement like the Renaissance in Russia. Glinka,--who lived from 1803 to 1857,--the author of two great operas,--was the pioneer of the national school of music.

Mrs. Hamerik then spoke of [Syeroffof? Alexander] Borodin, and of other composers, and of their works. She deferred also to the author of the noble Russian Hymn, sometimes called the greatest of all national anthems. She spoke of Rubinstein, born in 1830, of Jewish parents; who studied in Berlin, and founded in 1862, a Russian Conservatory of Music. In speaking of his Ocean Symphony, she said, he had when he composed it--never seen the ocean; and that he afterwards said he might never have written it if he had waited until he had been dreadfully sea sick in coming to America. She spoke of Tschaikowski as the greatest of Russian composers, a student under Rubinstein, but one who gives evidence of the Slavic temperament,--fiery enthusiasm with a stream of melancholy through it. She spoke [illegible] Tschaikowski’s seven operas and five

[215]

symphonies, especially of his last symphony finished a few days before his death, which occurred soon after that of Rubinstein. Mrs. Hamerik illustrated her essay by playing in her own fine style--six Russian compositions, and commenting on their characteristics. On giving those of [Anton] Arensky and Borodin, she spoke of a friend in St. Petersburg, who in writing to her had mentioned these two composers as, of course, unknown in America. She proposed to send this friend a programme of our meeting. Mrs. Hamerik gave us two selections from Tschaikowski, and one from Rubinstein--which were highly appreciated.

After pleasant greetings, conversation and refreshments, the meeting adjourned.

**Meeting of February 1st, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore met on Tuesday, February 1st, 1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Mrs. Waller R. Bullock, Chairman of the Committee on Education.

The meeting was called to order by the Second Vice President, Mrs. John M. Carter; and the Recording Secretary read the minutes of the two former meetings, those of the 18th and of the 25th of January. The subject of the meeting was announced. The relative importance of Latin and Greek and of Anglo Saxon in the study of the English language.

The first article of the programme was by Miss Imogen George; and was on “The Practical Uses of Anglo- Saxon.” Miss George spoke of the Aryan or Indo-European races, and of their

[216]

languages as derived from one primitive whole, with seven branches,--only four of these concerning us to any great extent. She spoke of the Sancrit [Sanskrit],--the elder brother of many tongues, of the Keltic [Celtic], the Saxon, the Greek, and especially the Teutonic. She spoke of the influences which have formed the English language, and of its growth and development in the fifteen centuries since Hengist and Horsa came to Britain,--bringing large, strong, practical Anglo-Saxon element. She referred to this element in old and recent writers. In speaking of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, she said the English of their time was peculiarly fitted for translations, this being the reason that Chapman’s Homer still holds its own among the later versions,--as does also King James’s Bible. Miss George spoke of the Latin and the Anglo-Saxon elements in the English language grammatically and critically;--she referred to the revival of the study of Anglo-Saxon literature; and read to us from Wordsworth and others, some specimens of forcible monosyllabic Saxon English writings. She spoke too of the respect for woman, of the fatalism, and of the strong philosophic spirit of our old ancestors,--of whom she gave as a type, Hamlet, as described in the Anglo-Saxon speech of Shakespeare.

The subject of debate was then announced as: “Is Anglo-Saxon More Important than Latin and Greek in the Study of the English Language.” A few introductory words were given by Mrs. [Caroline Canfield] Bullock. She acknowledged her obligations to Professor Uhler, and to Professor [James W.] Bright, who had lent valuable books for this occasion. She drew attention

[217]

to a portion of the Gothic translations of the Gospels made by Bishop Ulfilas in the fourth century, a copy of Beowulf, one of King Alfred’s letters to the Bishop of Worcester, and a copy of Chaucer’s “Legend of Good Women.” She said the subject of debate was not the literature, nor the mental stimulus to be derived, nor general culture gained from Latin and Greek or from Anglo-Saxon. She referred to the spirit of unrest among educators, and to the books on Rhetoric that are filled with the mistakes of great authors.

The Brief on the affirmative side of the question was given by Mrs. [Lucy Randolph] Cautley. She said she did not hold a brief against Latin and Greek, but for Anglo-Saxon. It has been said of the three greatest English- speaking Universities of the world, that their undergraduates speak and write every language correctly but their own. Mrs. Cautley made five points.

1st, Anglo-Saxon is old English itself--if deprived of all other elements, we would have still a living forcible form of speech, the sap would keep the trunk of the tree alive, though leaves and branches be stripped off.

2nd, It is scientifically necessary as the basis for the true study of English,--it is what embryology is to the biologist.

3rd, It is grammatically necessary, the knowledge of the grammar of the language can not be based on the study of another.

[218]

4th, It is a necessary gain in time,--the proficiency gained by one year in Anglo-Saxon, would require several years in Latin or Greek, and modern education can not leave science in general to alchemists and wizards, physiology to quacks, and physical culture to prize fighters, as in the days when the classics were all important.

5th, Mrs. Cautley’s fifth point was: The study of Anglo-Saxon as a necessity for a good English style,--and a corrective to the prolonged study of Latin. Our great masters have held this, consciously or unconsciously; and, she said, the universal taste has supported them. She believed no one knowing the classics would undervalue them; but their place in an English education is not its basis, but as the crown and glory of an English curriculum,--better mastered and comprehended after the preparation of a scientifically correct mode of training.

The next article was by Miss Giffen, and was on the negative side of the debate,--that of the Classics. Miss Giffen spoke of the fact that we are a mixed people as applying also to our language. We have many words from many tongues; but the quantity of an element does not make it valuable. We have heard of a tribe who have some fifty words for a sword, and only one for truth;--of another having a name for every vice, but none for a virtue, and of an Eastern language with many artistic terms, but no word for purity. She thought that we could not disassociate a language from its literature,

[219]

in regarding its relative importance for education; and that the Anglo-Saxon literature is almost nothing,--or nothing of the rank of the classics.

The next article was by Miss L. W. [Lizette Woodworth] Reese, and on the affirmative side. Miss Reese spoke of the Anglo-Saxon as the bone and sinew of our language. She dwelt on its power in poetry,--in lyrical expression. It is a treasure house, modern English owes to it the power of forming compounds. She spoke of the brevity and appropriateness of the Saxon words for the things of every day living,--and for strength and love and grief, and for all the deep and final things of human life. Anglo Saxon began its development in an historical sense, five hundred years before the Norman conquest. Its study will help us to unfold petal by petal the flower of the past. “Are we not,” Miss Reese asked “sentimental about the Classics?” We study Caesar or Virgil, and after a year or two we have a few proverbs left. “Are the classics the only good mental discipline?” Can not the science of mathematics do as much--or more--for us?” Style is not bought. Even Saxon vigor, Keltic [Celtic] color, or Latin precision do not teach us style, but Anglo Saxon can help us to good English composition. We can use the speech of our sea-faring ancestors and seem to hear the sounds of the trumpets and of the sea coming down to us.

The next speaker was Miss Ellen Duvall,--on the negative side of the question. Miss Duvall suggested that we could not limit ourselves to one element in our language at any time. She would take our Anglo-Saxon and our later Latin and Greek,--not as

[220]

separate groups, but as one language in full flow and power; and not for origin so much as for end and use. Anglo Saxon is wanting in many respects, it is different from most modern tongues. Our English tenses require some reference to Latin or Greek. There are peculiarities in Anglo Saxon moods, and in the construction of sentences. Modern Anglo Saxon grammars are more or less based on German forms. Miss Duvall said that she had not understood that the relative merits of literature were to be excluded from discussion. Mrs. [Caroline Canfield] Bullock said this point could only be referred to the courtesy of the other side. Understanding that the members on the other side would by courtesy admit the presentation of the literary view of the subject.

Miss Duvall after speaking of the earliest Saxon literature, referred to the Christian Anglo Saxon writings and spoke of the influence of the Latin used by the Church, its priests and their pupils. She considered the old Anglo Saxon literature of great interest to the student of Psychology, as showing certain tendencies and stages of thought. All sources of thought and progress are valuable; but life and time are short and we may not be able to give the Anglo Saxon language and literature a like value with those of Greece and Rome.

Mrs. Bullock announced the arrival of the time for general debate. Mrs. Tyson spoke of the civilization that came to England with the Norman invaders,--and their language as <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">our mother tongue,</span>--worthy of our reverence and of the English language as a young [giant?]

[221]

stepping over the world. She spoke of the bad termination of such words as “though” and “through,” saying the “ough” was not Saxon, but Danish, and ought to be abolished. Miss Giffen said that in reverencing our ancestors we should not forget our grandparents and could reverence an original tongue like the Sanscrit [Sanskrit].

Miss [Anne Weston] Whitney spoke of the power of environment and habits of thought on literature. The Anglo-Saxon writings give us purity of thought, and the effect of religious faith and sense of duty. Alfred’s Pastoral tells of a life ideal; Latin and Greek literatures take us into a life corrupted. The ruins of nations do not give us the highest ideas. Some grave moral failings, and some intellectual vices have been said to be directly due to the study of the classics. If we would keep thought pure, let us keep to the noble thoughts of Anglo Saxons.

Miss [Ellen] Duvall said that Alfred’s beautiful idea of life was Jewish and Christian; not Anglo-Saxon. Miss Whitney said that the Anglo Saxon was embraced in it also.

Miss [Elizabeth Cary] Nicholas spoke of the effect of Latinized speech on the unsophisticated mind. She also read Dr. Johnson’s elaborate definition of “a net.”

Miss Szold, a former member, spoke of the effect of the study of the classics in the development of culture and style;--and urged that if Anglo-Saxon or Latin and Greek should be left out of the education of our young people,--the classic tongues should not be the omitted ones. She thought the English learned from Chaucer and Spenser

[222]

who were classic scholars, was not that of the older Anglo-Saxons. She dwelt on the need of giving children more English literature than they now receive; and she spoke of the formative power of good translations.

Mrs. Cautley spoke of the discipline gained from the study of mathematics. She said that Sanscrit [Sanskrit] was not as much a root language as an elder brother in Languages.

After further remarks by Mrs. Sloan, Mrs. Cautley, Mrs. Bullock and others, the vote was called for and all present were asked to vote on the relative importance of Anglo-Saxon or Latin and Greek in the study of the English Language.

The announcement was eleven for the Classic tongues, and nine for the Anglo-Saxon; but it was very much regretted that a number of the members had left the room before the voting began, and some seemed to have refrained from voting; by which means the result could hardly be a satisfactory expression of opinion to either side--though the debate had been of great interest to all.

The meeting adjourned.

**Meeting of February 8th, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, February 8th, 1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Miss Virginia [Woodward] Cloud, Chairman of the Committee on Fiction. The meeting was

[223]

called to order by the Second Vice President, Mrs. John M. Carter, and the Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of February 1st.

The first article of the programme was by Mrs. Percy [Elizabeth McCormick] Reese, and was called “Doria’s Forgiveness.” It was a tale of early love, of an inconstant lover, and a brave uncomplaining woman, of a late forgiveness, and the revelation of a more worthy affection and a true devotion.

The next article of the programme was by Miss Annie Weston Whitney; and was a story called “Conspirators.” It told of the inherited loyalty of a colored boy--Jim--to the white family who had been the owners and protectors of his grandparents in the patriarchal days “before the war.” The scenes were laid in our own city, and began in an oyster packing house, in which the aforesaid Jim, and his partner Caesar, during the intervals of their work, form a conspiracy, whereof the object is that “old mistress” and Miss Helen and the children” shall have a real Thanksgiving dinner served in the style of the old Southern home--so far as the conspirators can remember or accomplish it. And all of this is done to the satisfaction of the conspirators, and the mystified thankfulness of the family. But the secret is too heavy for the dark conspirators, Jim, who finds it necessary to leave the city, for fear that he shall tell--without meaning to. The unconscious humor of the plotters pervades the whole story.

The presiding officer then read a letter from Miss May Evans, acknowledging and expressing her thanks for the flowers sent her on the occasion of the concert to which

[224]

she had invited her fellow members of the Club.

The next article of the programme was “A Critique,” by Miss Ellen Duvall. The book reviewed by Miss Duvall was: “Old Lamps for New Ones;”--being a lately published collection of the short articles and Essays of Charles Dickens. Miss Duvall told us the book did not contain perhaps the best work of Dickens; but there is no chaff in it,--it will not injure his fame, and there is much to remind us of the old manly truth, the broad love for humanity, the humor and kindliness and pathos that we have loved and admired. She spoke of his paper on the “Ragged Schools,” published in 1846, in the London Daily News; also of the notice of the benefit of Mr. McCready the great actor,--of this last as giving the criticism on one artiste by another artist of another kind. Miss Duvall spoke too of the “American Notes,” at which the Americans took umbrage some fifty years ago. She asked if many of his criticisms were not just at that time, and if some of them would not be just even now. She thought this book would give the same impression as that conveyed the body of the works of the old Dickens, who made many of us laugh and cry long ago.

The last article of the programme was “A Recitation” by Mrs. G. J. [Sarah J.] Wilmer. She gave us a Selection from Dickens’s “Barnaby Rudge,” with much comic force and spirit.

The meeting adjourned.

[225]

**Meeting of February 15th, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, February 15th, 1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Mrs. R. M. [Elizabeth J.] Wylie, Chairman of the Committee on Art.

The meeting was called to order by the President, Mrs. Turnbull; who spoke of her pleasure in meeting us again, and also referred to some pleasant things she had heard said about the work of the Club during her short absence.

The Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of February 8th. Announcement was made of the lectures of Mrs. Houghton of New York on Bible Literature; and also of the lectures on Dante of Miss Susan T. Blow. The President also spoke of the new magazine, “Child Garden, for little children;” and announced the reception of the Calendar of the New Century Club.

The first article from the programme was by Mrs. R. M. [Elizabeth J.] Wylie, and was called “The Court of Love.” Mrs. Wylie called our attention to the copy of a fine picture called by this name, and representing eight pairs of lovers. The original fresco painting adorns one of the rooms of Eaton Hall, the splendid seat of the Duke of Westminster, some four miles from Chester. She gave a short account of her visit to Eaton Hall, and told of its treasures of art, and artistic decorations. Returning to the picture, she spoke of the Eros, the Hymen and the type of Constancy; and then described its eight pairs of lovers. She showed us Raphael

[226]

And hs Fornarina, with the fair young face, that “on her lover shone,--

Whose picture of an angel’s grace, 
Was borrowed from her own.”

After referring to some of the legends regarding this somewhat mysterious love affair of the great master of painting, Mrs. Wylie went on to speak of Fra Lippo Lippi, and Lucrezia Buti, reminding us of Robert Browning’s very vivid account of the artist monk and lover; who finally she said--gained a dispensation to be married.

The third pair were the immortal lovers Dante and Beatrice. Then came before us the less spiritual but truly romantic love of Petrach and Laura.

Mrs. Wylie went on to the English Henry the Second and Fair Rosamond, whose story, we were reminded, is now said to have been disproved, though it still holds its place in legend and song.

Next came the lovers Pudens and Claudia, connecting old Rome and old Britain together. A more remarkable connection came in the legend of the seventh pair--Cassivelannus [Cassivellaunus] and Flur, making the British chieftain on the banks of the Thames and Julius Caesar rivals in love. Tennyson has told us of “the bride of Cassivelannus [Cassivellaunus], Flur,

“for whose love the Roman Caesar first  
Invaded Britain, but we beat him back.” 

The last pair of lovers were Anthony and Cleopatra,--”for whom he threw the world away.”

Mrs. Wylie closed her article with Lylte’s

[227]

poem in which the dying Anthony calls upon Cleopatra to 

“light the Stygian horrors--  
With the splendor of her smile.”

The next article of the programme was by Mrs. Morton Sloan, and was on “Caricaturists, and their Work.” Mrs. Sloan reminded us that laughter has been called necessary to the well-being of humanity, that Cicero and Erasmus were fond of jesting and that the greatest of ancient writers did not disdain the good stories and sayings that cause laughter. She spoke of wit and satire from the comedies of Aristophanes to the medieval king’s fool and to the modern clown. She traced the early tendency to accentuate the resemblance of our human race to its humbler animal relations; from Esop’s [Aesop] fables onward to the days when Isegrim, the Wolf, Reynard the fox, Bruin and the rest took their places in Folk-lore, and imitative art.

She spoke of the earliest attempts to make caricatures and of those seen on the Assyrian and Egyptian sculptures that remain to us. She dwelt on the gulf between ancient and modern art, how art became debased under the Caesars, and how the first Christian churches were built by pagan hands, and were not without pagan decorations. She told of some of the grotesque figures in the churches of the middle ages, and of their caricatures of Death and of the Prince of Darkness. She went to the sixteenth century when the religious conflicts gave many subjects for grim or burlesque representations. She

[228]

spoke too of the caricaturists of different nations, contrasting those of France with those of Germany and Holland. Coming to English caricature, Mrs. Sloan spoke of those popular in the days of Charles the First, and in the Restoration, when Cavalier and Puritan satirized each other. She went on to the days of the Georges; and to those more familiar to us of Cruickshank and Doyle, to the London Punch, and to the true comedy of John Leech and George DuMaurier,--to the pleasantry without coarseness, whose mission is to make us glad.

The last article from the programme was by Mrs. G. J. [Sarah J.] Wilmer, and was on “Art, as shown by Shakespeare.” Mrs. Wilmer spoke of the art of Shakespeare as shown in all that he wrote, though each scene is true to nature for the time being. She thought we would like to have lived with his characters in the Forest of Arden; and she dwelt particularly on the character of Rosalind; and spoke of the dignity of an enlarged mind, shown in spite of the admirable fooling in this idyllic play. She spoke of the element of tragedy shown in the character of Shylock. Though there is no actual killing in the Merchant of Venice, the tremendous force of the insulted, enraged type of his race is tragical enough, coming through the love-making and friendships of the other characters. Shylock, she said, had been treated as a sort of buffoon until Chalres Macklin in 1741, gave the first true conception of his character, and caused Mr. Pope to say: “This is the Jew that Shakespeare drew.” Hamlet, it has been said, is Shakespeare himself. She then went on to speak of the most tragic

[229]

of all the plays, the one which gives us Othello, Desdemona and Iago, with such wonderful dramatic art. Mrs. Wilmer then gave us recitations from the Merchant of Venice,--closing with the trial scene--which were enjoyed and appreciated.

The meeting adjourned.

**Meeting of February 22nd, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, February 22nd, 1898. This was a social meeting being the last one of the month, and no regular programme had been prepared for it. Being the birthday of George Washington, all the exercises were of the patriotic character appropriate to that anniversary. Miniature “star-spangled banners,” were given to the members on their arrival, to be worn as badges during the meeting.

The President in opening the meeting spoke of the one thought in all our minds, the one sentiment inspiring us--our reverence for the “Father of our Country.” The Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of February 15th.

Mrs. Thomas [Harriet Louise Wescott] Hill then gave a short and comprehensive account of the Washington Memorial Association of American Women, and of the appeal to the women of our whole country to join in carrying out the provisions of the will of George Washington, made a century ago, and still unfulfilled with regard to the foundation of a National University at the National Capital, of the highest and broadest character. Mrs. Hill spoke of the officers of the association of women who have been moved to take up the long deferred

[230]

work, and also of the distinguished men who approve of and co-operate in it.

Mrs. Francis P. Stevens then said a few words in presenting to the Club the Autograph of Lieutenant A. W. Greeley, the well-known Arctic explorer. She told of its having been given to her by Lieutenant Greeley on the occasion of the anniversary exercises of Johns Hopkins University in 1885, at which he was an honored guest. He had written the words of the prophet Daniel: “Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased,” over his signature. Mrs. Stevens also brought to the Club as a present from President Gilman, a beautiful copy of the Official Seal of the University, as just received from the Herald’s office in London.

Our President then spoke of the close connection we all feel with the great University in our own city, and of our appreciation of its work, especially of its post graduate work.

Miss Mary Grace then entertained the Club by reading interesting extracts from two new books: Paul Leicester Ford’s new “Life of General Washington,” and “Hugh Wynne,” the novel of Dr. Weir Mitchell.

The President recalled to us the history of the spurious letters of General Washington, and also reminded us of the incident which had interested us several years ago, when these letters were given to a lady in Detroit as genuine documents; but she immediately discerned the fraud,--which has been clearly revealed and dispelled.

The rest of the afternoon was passed with conversation and tea and cakes, which last took the supposed shape of George Washington’s juvenile hatchet, long enshrined in the hearts of juvenile Americans. The meeting adjourned.

[231]

**Meeting of March 1st, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore met on Tuesday, March 1st, 1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Mrs. John M. Carter, Chairman of the Committee on Philanthropy.

The President called the meeting to order. She spoke briefly of the affliction of our Corresponding Secretary, Mrs. John M. [Maria W.] Miller, in the death of her only daughter; and suggested the expression to her of the sympathy of her fellow members. It was moved by Mrs. Sloane, and seconded by Miss [Jane] Zacharias that the President should appoint a Committee to draw up a resolution of sympathy with Mrs. Miller,--which motion was immediately adopted. The President appointed Miss Virginia [Woodward] Cloud[,] Chairman of this Committee with power to choose two other members as her colleagues.

At the suggestion of the Recording Secretary, the reading of the minutes was omitted on account of the lateness of the hour.

The first article of the programme was by Miss Fannie H. Shackelford, and announced as: “What is Philanthropy?” Miss Shackelford spoke of the original derivation of the word philanthropy,--of its earliest kindred terms, of its resemblance to the word philosophy,--and of its meaning love for man, a meaning higher and nobler than that of the word humanity. She

[232]

went on to speak of the great philanthropist, St. Vincent de Paul, and of his noble work in the sixteenth century, especially of his wise and successful measures of relief to the miseries consequent upon the siege of Paris; and of his other works still bearing fruit in the world. She then took up the story of the English John Howard, who also gave up his life to serving the miserable, and forsaken, who worked in different countries and who died in his work far from home She spoke too of David Livingston, and his labors in Africa. She suggested that the devoted lives of the true followers of Christ tell us what is Philanthropy.

The next article was by Mrs. P. R. [Pearl D.] Uhler, and was called: “Poor Jack Ashore.” Mrs. Uhler spoke of the sailor as comparatively known to people on the land. She referred to his child-like symplicity [simplicity] and openness and liability to be deceived. She spoke of the admiration aroused by Richard Henry Dana’s book. “Two Years before the Mast,” as a true picture of actual experiences of a sailor’s life, and characterised it as one of the publications that has done much to ameliorate the condition of sailors on merchant ships. She spoke of the susceptibility of sea-farers to good influences, and of the efforts that have been made to bring them under such good influences,--in New York since 1770, and also in Baltimore since 1820. She told of the homes opened for them in seaports; of the libraries given for their use at sea, and at the life-saving stations. She went on to speak of the Baltimore Port Mission, and of similar agencies for good. Interesting information on these subjects was also given by Mrs. Bullock, Mrs. [Lucy Randolph] Cautley, Miss Zacharias, and Mrs. Edward A. Robinson, and notice was given of the means of sending books

[233]

and periodicals to seamen who would appreciate them highly.

The next article of the programme was by Miss E. C. [Elizabeth Cary] Nicholas, and was called: “A Remembrance of Morley College, London.” Miss [Elizabeth Cary] Nicholas spoke of the necessity in attempting to improve the condition of the poor, to strive towards making them self-reliant men and women,--and to teach them to live, “not by bread alone.” She gave an account of the College founded by Sir Samuel Morley in a part of London where such an institution was needed; of its twelve teachers, and especially of one lady who for years has devoted her life to the elevating work of that branch of philanthropy. She gave a description of entertainment given there, at which she was a guest. She spoke of the heroism and faith needed for the work of philanthropy, in which success depends far more on the heart than on the purse.

The Presiding officer announced that our honorary member, Mrs. Latimer had presented to the Club her newly published book: “Spain in the Nineteenth Century.” Miss [Mary F.] Grace spoke of having been herself in Spain while some of the events related in this book were taking place, and of having recognized its correct account of them.

The Committee to draft a resolution of sympathy with our Corresponding Secretary now presented the resolution which received immediate agreement.

The next article was by Miss Helen T. Goessmann, and was on “The Children of the Good Shepherd; An Impression of Philanthropy.” Miss Goessmann suggested that however creeds and dogma may differ, Christianity must include true philanthropy. She went on to

[234]

tell of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd, whose work, she said, was not sectarian, though it was under the direction of one Church. Here fine and true women work for the redemption of the fallen, and for the salvation of the children in danger of becoming such. She described visits she had been permitted to make to the Houses of the Good Shepherd in New Orleans and in Baltimore. She gave a beautiful word picture of the Mother Superior in New Orleans, telling of her wise and gentle and successful methods for reformation,--sometimes effectual where the efforts of all others had failed.

It was announced that during the absence of Mrs. [Maria W.] Miller, Miss [Anne Weston] Whitney had consented to undertake, temporarily, the work of the Corresponding Secretary.

The meeting adjourned.

**Meeting March 8th, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, March 8th, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Mrs. C. W. [Alice Emma Sauerwein] Lord, Chairman of the Committee on Essays and Essayists.

The President called the meeting to order, and announced the absence of the Recording Secretary,--owing to an accident. The President also announced the reception of a letter from the Corresponding Secretary, Mrs. [Maria W.] Miller, expressing her appreciation of the flowers and the resolution of sympathy received by her from the Club. Announcement was made of the lectures of Mrs. [Miss] Haughton at the home of Mrs. John D. [Maud Graham] Early; also of the fellowship offered by the Baltimore

[235]

Association for the advancement of Women. It was agreed to send congratulations to Mr. Richard Malcolm Johnston on the occasion of his seventy-sixth birthday.

Mrs. Turnbull then read from the Revue des Deux Mondes, a translation of Madame Blanc, of Sidney Lanier’s poem “My Springs,” into French prose,--showing how readily the poem lent itself to this adaptation.

The first article of the programme was by Mrs. C. W. [Alice Emma Sauerwein] Lord, and was called a “Comparison of the Writers of To-Day.” Mrs. [Alice Emma Sauerwein] Lord spoke of the impossibility of keeping pace with our current literature. We read in a hurry, perhaps analyze to some extent, but we do not learn to know and love our contemporary writers as some of us did in the old days of Thackeray and Dickens. She spoke of Robert Louis Stevenson and of his genius which was winning the public heart, while he himself, it seems, was fighting a battle between soul and body, in one sense greater than that between Dr. Jekyle [Jekyll] and Mr. Hyde.

Rudyard Kipling, she said, with an imagination running riot in weird portrayals of fact and fancy, was a sort of English Du Maupassant. She spoke of his work in connection with that of his brother-in-law [Wolcott] Balestier, and thought the latter would have been as great a writer as Kipling, but for his early death.

She then spoke of [George] Du Maurier, and of his sudden rising into literary fame after years of Art work. She gave him credit for pictorial and literary talent. She went on to Thomas Hardy, and to the strength of his portrayals of rustic life, and dwelt on his great

[236]

theme,--suffering for sin. Hall Caine, she said at first, chose simple, almost barbarian life. His late work “The Christian” was powerful, but disappointing. In speaking of Mrs. Humphrey Ward, she said that her heroine, Marcella, tries to live up to her ideals, and fails; while her husband doing the duties that come to him, accomplishes more in the end. Mrs. [Alice Emma Sauerwein] Lord touched upon Weyman and Hope, and also on Conan Doyle. [Israel] Zangwill, she said depicts the Jew, with great human interest. She then spoke of his book “The Master,” and of his forcible essays and criticism. Of Marion Crawford, she thought his Italian stories were better than his American ones.

Mrs. [Alice Emma Sauerwein] Lord said that the English acknowledge but few of our writers, possibly because they have no literary piracy to cheapen the books they read. Walt Whitman, she suggested was to them a sort of Buffalo Bill in literature. She then spoke of [William Dean] Howells as a seeker after truth, who finds more flaws than perfections in life. Henry James keeps his subjects under the microscope, and sees them sometimes with English eyes, and sometimes otherwise. She thought it refreshing to turn to the poet novelist, James Lane Allen, in his “Kentucky Cardinal,” and “The Choir Invisible.”

Mrs. Lord next spoke of [Henryk] Sinkiewicz, and his widely read work “Quo Vadis.” She spoke of [Henry Seton] Merriman, and criticized his book “The Sowers.” She passed on to Paul Leicester Ford’s “Peter Stirling,” the interest whereof has been heightened by the suggestion that President Cleveland was in the mind of the author when he wrote it.

The next article of the programme

[237]

was by Mrs. Frederick [Florence McIntyre] Tyson, and was her own translation of the Italian novel “The War of the Saints,” by [Giovanni] Verga. Mrs. Tyson introduced her translation by giving some account of the present writers of fiction in Italy. This story by Verga told of a village in Sicilly [Sicily], where, in the rival factions of two patron Saints, mundane party feeling ran so high that the followers of San Bocco fought with the followers of San Pasquale. A pair of lovers are parted by the quarrel,--the fair Zerita, it was said, having shown herself as ready to box Mino as if she had been already been married to him. But the plague and drought, and loss of worldly goods comes to the village, and to the lovers. Sorrows and the shadow of death bring the followers of the Saints to a more saint like frame of mind, and peace comes back to the lovers.

The next article of the programme was by Mrs. B. Howard Haman, and was called: “A Journey through Devonshire.” Mrs. Harman told of her journey through southwestern England made in November 1894. She spoke first of the quaint Cornish town of Penzance eight hours from London. She went on to tell of the beauties of Devonshire, and of its historical associations; of its lovely flowers, and cruel looking cliffs. She described Clovelly,--or cleft valley--with its streets like a stone staircase rising upward. She told of Dartmoor; of Exeter, with its Cathedral. She spoke of Devonshire as the birthplace of remarkable men, such as Raleigh, Drake, Kingsley and Fronde. She thought it impossible to say of the scenery of Ross-shire in Scotland, or of that of Devonshire in England, which was

[238]

the fairer--in sight or in memory.

Miss Mary Grace then read to the Club a story of early Buddhism, published in Tokyo, and admired by Tolstoi, and other European writers. It told of Karma,--the mysterious doctrine of the Buddhist system of faith. It also included a beautiful little story,--which might remind us a little of our Lord’s parable of Lazarus and Dives, and teaching the essential evil of selfishness and self seeking--from the Buddhist point of view,--and possibly not from that alone.

The meeting adjourned.

**Meeting of March 15th, 1898.**

The Woman’s Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, March 15th, 1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Miss Mary F. Grace, Chairman of the Committee on Translations.

The President called the meeting to order, and Miss [Anne Weston] Whitney read the minutes of the meeting of March 8th.

The first article of the programme was by Miss Mullin, and was her translation of “The Codicil,” by Paul Ferier [Ferrier?]. It was the comedy of a rich widow who tries and proves her lovers by telling them of a fictitious codicil which would deprive her of her fortune, if she were to marry again. One lover stands the test; but she suspects him of having been informed of her little stratagem. But the letter meant to enlighten him is discovered unopened, when follows the happy dénoument.

The next article of the programme was

[239]

given by Mrs. T. J. Morris, and was her translation from St. [Berne?] of “The Founding of the French Academy.” She gave an account of the first quiet meetings of the chosen few literary men; who criticized and encouraged each other, keeping their association a secret; and in later years talking of it as “the golden age.” She told of Richelieu’s conception of what the organization might be; of his converting it into a national institution; and of the great results that have grown out of it.

Mrs. Morris next read her translation of a charming little story of “The Man Who Warmed Himself without Cost.” His home was a garret without fire, but, by the simple device of spending his days in the lecture rooms; and his nights in the public libraries,--he kept himself warm without paying for fuel.

Miss [Mary F.] Grace then read to the Club the fine translation by our honorary member, Mrs. Latimer, of “The Pater,” a story by Francis Coppée. It told with powerful pathos of the days of the rule of “The Commune” in Paris in 1871.

The meeting adjourned.

**Meeting of March 22nd, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, March 22nd, 1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Mrs. Waller R. Bullock, Chairman of the Committee on Education.

The President called the meeting to order. As the evening was devoted to a discussion of some length, the minutes were omitted. The President read a letter received by Miss [Anne Weston] Whitney

[240]

acting Corresponding Secretary, from Colonel Richard Malcolm Johnston gracefully acknowledging the congratulations sent him by the Woman’s Literary Club on the occasion of his seventy-sixth birthday.

The subject of Discussion was then announced as “Do we need a National University, conferring Degrees.” The first speaker was Mrs. Fabian Franklin, who took the affirmative side. She spoke of the bequest for this object, by General Washington, of $25,000, the money having now disappeared; but which, if it had been held at interest, would now amount to $4,500,000. This sum it is proposed that Congress shall appropriate, to carry out the wise and patriotic intention of the Father of our country. In furtherance of this cause, an Association of American Women propose to raise $250,000, to erect an Administration Building--which will be needed for this University--in advance of the action of Congress. She then gave the reasons of the necessity of such a University at the national capital. While we have excellent, but local universities, we have not one truly national, worthy of our great country as a whole, whose wealth and power and influence demand an educational institution of equal eminence. She spoke of the excellent and high character and influences of some of the German universities; but contrasting them with the highest ranking, far-reaching and powerful University of Berlin, which invites great scholars from the other institutions, who come gladly and gratefully to join the ranks of her honored professors. She dwelt on the advantages of having such an institution in Washington as an antidote to sectionalism. It would she believed train young men and young women

[241]

in higher education and higher views of life, through its post-graduate character. Mrs. Franklin combatted the idea of the danger of political influence; or that of any injury or failure of support to colleges in other parts of the country. These, she thought, and their patrons would believe and find it truly beneficial to have a great University to which their students could go forward from their own course of study.

The next speaker was Miss [Anne Weston] Whitney, who was announced as on the negative side. Miss Whitney took the ground that we have already in Washington the institution described as necessary to us, though not as yet organized as a university. But the organization and the power to confer degrees could be added by Congress, if desired. She went on to describe the Institute founded under the provisions of the will of James Smithson, an Englishman who left more than half a million dollars to the United States Government, to be devoted “to the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” Miss Whitney then gave a comprehensive and interesting account of the Smithsonian Institute, from its foundation in 1846, to the present time. She told of its methods, its great facilities for investigation, its results, its promoters, and the men, eminent in science who have been aided or developed by it. She described its different departments, its present condition and capabilities. She told of its Board of Regents, and of the three, and only three, Secretaries--or really Superintendents--since its beginning, Professors [Joseph] Henry, [Spence] Baird and [Samuel] Langley,--the last named being in office. Now. She dwelt on the freedom from political changes that has characterized its personal representatives. She

[242]

told of its far-reaching influences, its power and resources, its capabilities of increase, and development and organization.

The next speaker was Mrs. [Lucy Randolph] Cautley, on the affirmative side. Mrs. Cautley said that she had not known that she was to speak; but that after Miss Whitney’s able reasoning for giving the name and powers of a university to an existing institution, she would treat the question from its sentimental side. We are in need of solidarity,--of those strong points which shall attract and hold our patriotism. She told of an American girl who was much affected while in England by hearing a large assembly singing “God save the Queen,” in full feeling and unison. We do not learn much enthusiasm for our President,--who is only such for four years,--nor for Congress especially of late years. A grand world-famous university would build up that feeling of patriotism, which is promoted by the great central university of the German Empire, and by those of our mother country. Its diplomas would have proper recognition, it would be truly national. Mrs. Cautley said that such a university would be a barrier and opponent to the public corruption of which we hear so much,--a cleansing and pure influence for the well-being of our nation.

The next speaker was Miss Duvall, on the negative side. Miss Duvall spoke of the ideal presented to us as a beautiful one, but it is not a thing to be agitated now. It exists in rather a formless state; but why should it be changed? The Smithsonian Institute was founded more than fifty years ago, when the personnel of our government was higher than it is now. She spoke of a bill having once been

[243]

prepared for the choosing of its regents by lot,--a plan which may have had its advantages in the days of Jonah, but not in our times. Another proposition was to establish in it the principal [principle] of rotation in office. She spoke of the danger of the offices of a University being subject to change by the party temporarily in power, or by a majority in Congress. Miss Duvall went on to describe the injustice that has been done by the disappearance of the Naval Pension Fund, established by the members of the Navy themselves in the second war with Great Britain. She thought that in view of the deficit in our Governmental income, and the late appropriation of $50,000,000, for defense, we have not money enough for the proposed national university, and that it would be worse than useless to go before Congress with the proposition for it now.

The next speaker was Miss Shackelford, on the affirmative side. Miss Shackelford thought that the proposed University would advance national feeling in these United States, who ought to realize the vision of the English poet in being “Distinct as the billows, yet one as the sea.” The University would be for the uplifting of man, from its foundations in Washington its influence would go forth to the nation and to the world, it would set the capstone to the public schools of the United States, from the east and the west the young people would come to it, and gifted ones would go forth from it well-equipped to make high ideals take their places among realities.

The next speaker was Miss Middleton’ and on the negative side. She spoke of the University as truly desirable, but did not wish

[244]

to see Washington its chosen site; not because Washington has been called malarious, for it is now said to be healthy, but because it is charged with politics. Every body there seems to have an opinion on every measure before Congress, everyone seems to be biassed [biased], it is not the soil where intellect and virtue will thrive. She wished to see the University founded, and named after our greatest man, but not at or near the capital of the United States.

The next speaker was Mrs. Sloan, on the affirmative side. Mrs. Sloan said that she had ready a spread eagle speech, but Miss Duvall had clipped her wings. She had thought that we of all the people in the world, the heirs of all the ages, with our unbounded horizon, and our opportunities for individual effort ought to found a University worthy of our nation, and of our dreams and hopes for all coming time.

Mrs. [Caroline Canfield] Bullock then summed up the arguments on the affirmative side. She dwelt on the necessity for a University which would make it unnecessary for our young men and women to go abroad for advantages which do not seem attainable here now and seem in future attainable by governmental aid. Education at home would lead to purer patriotism, to truer family life. She thought the low politician would not dare to interfere with such an institution, or such interference would not be tolerated. It would be a rallying point for men of science, and for congenial great minds. In the struggle for existence, we cannot depend on genius to make its own way, we owe to the rising generation to give it all the advantages in the power of

[245]

A great nation. The President suggested the question whether patriotism would not be more furthered by a national University than by the support of the existing Universities; whether students would not go back to their own states more impartial than if they had not gone to a national institution. She spoke of the rivalries of the Italian republics, and suggested the possibilities that might have followed, or the effects that might have been lost from the centralization of their forces and opportunities.

Mrs. Stevens then summed up the arguments of the negative side. She also dwelt on the fact that Washington’s wise and patriotic reasonings were written down a century ago, and she quoted the views of Jefferson and of Edmund Randolph written at the same time. In those days travelling was by coaches; a person left Boston on Monday morning and arrived at Washington on Wednesday night. Many other conditions also have changed since then. Students are not obliged to go abroad for higher education now, as then; and those of us who do go, and do not return with greater love for and faith in their country are generally not the students. She referred to the war cloud hanging over us, and asked if Washington were President now, would he have still the views of 1795.

The vote was taken on the subject of discussion, the result being a tie--the same number on each side.

The meeting adjourned.

[246]

**Meeting of March 29th, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, March 29th, 1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Miss Virginia Woodward Cloud, Chairman of the Committee on Fiction. The meeting was called to order by the First Vice President, Mrs. Wrenshall. The Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of March 22nd.

The first article of the programme was a “Short Story,” by Miss Cloud. It was called: “The Clever Idea of the Lord Mayor;” being one of her “Lord Mayor Series” of stories. In the Lord Mayor of Derby Cross, Miss Cloud gave an entertaining delineation of vanity and self-sufficiency, unconscious and serene, until his hero tries to impress his fellow-citizens to the point of naming him as the greatest and wisest man in Derby Cross. Indifference or resentment prompt the “Retort un-courteous,”--or the “Reply churlish,” until the mother-wit of a clever dairy maid answers a fool according to his folly,--to his satisfaction, and her own.

The next article of the programme was by Mrs. R. K. [Lucy Randolph] Cautley, and was an “Essay:” “Stirrings after Style.” Mrs. Cautley spoke of style in Art,--an[d] then of style in literature. She spoke of many definitions of style, as satisfactory only for a little while; such as “the right arrangement” or “choice of words” or “the music of words.” The writings of some great authors is [are] not musical. She compared the style of Carlyle to a Cathedral chime, which could be discordant often. It had

[247]

been said that much of Carlyle’s strength lay in his vigorous Dumfriesshire dialect, but for him this dialect interpreted the speech of an old Hebrew prophet. There must be thought as well as sound, there must be loyalty akin to religious faith, for the best style. With full knowledge of counterpoint, and of musical instruction, one might be able to write a correct symphony,--but not one of Beethoven’s symphonies.

She told of a man who hated music so much that hearing it made him wish to howl. Of course he married a lady devoted to music. He became her coadjutor, attempted musical composition, and achieved a work scientifically perfect, which no musician could bear to hear.

Mrs. Cautley referred to the style of Ruskin, to the fine English style of Shakespeare, and Milton and to the style of the best French and German authors. She spoke of the sense of form and of grace, and of the skill of the workman who never despises his tools,--the words he uses. She went on to fashions in literature and to unique, and to iridescent styles. She spoke of George Meredith, whose works seem to read like bad translations from the German, and whom she considered too pessimistic to be broad. She admired Thackeray’s style, not so much in Vanity Fair, as in his descriptions of Colonel Newcome and his niece Ethel, and Warrington, with their nobility of outlook. She spoke of Robert Louis Stevenson; of his sympathy with noble aims, and their proper expression; his evident close friendships with the

[248]

characters in his books; giving a high estimate of his style. If, she suggested, we were expecting a message from a King, to give to our neighbors, we would prepare ourselves to receive it; and would be careful to give it to others in no mean way,--nor ignoble words.

The programme had promised an article by Mrs. Frederick [Florence McIntyre] Tyson, but that lady being absent by reason of stormy weather, it was deferred.

The next article was by Mrs. R. W. Latimer and was a story called “The Price of Safety.” Mrs. Latimer’s story which had been published some time ago, was founded on her own experiences and observations during the stormy days of February 1848, in Paris, when a revolution drove the King, Louis Philippe, from his throne. She pictured a young American girl, and showed us in the picture, the national grace and charm that many of our young compatriots possess in themselves, and to the eyes and minds of some Englishmen,--and Frenchmen also. She told of this young lady, having in her charge, her nervous frightened mother, her younger sister and a colored nurse, trying to leave Paris, but stopped on the way, at a neighboring village, by a mob of revolutionists, who call themselves aristocrats, compelled them to descend from their carriage and stand in the road, not knowing what fate may befall them. They are joined by a young English gentleman, a recent acquaintance; who, though brave and strong is only one man against many, and cannot do as much for their safety as the young American herself can do. She does not object to join in the cry

[249]

“Vive la Republic.” But being requested to kiss her fellow republicans, she declines such an un-American custom; and taking up a very little boy, kisses him as a representative republican. She then requests to be joined in wishing long life to the Republic of the United States. So she gains safety for the whole party, and of course, the young Englishman falls in love,--and so does the young American.

The next article was a story by Miss Virginia [Woodward] Cloud; called “From Fool’s Gulch.” It told of two miners who were returning home from Fool’s Gulch gold mine; and gave a picture of disappointment and despair; of true love and silent unappreciated renunciation of self-sacrifice, which sounded the depths of a human heart, a deep well, where loyalty and truth were not found wanting.

The next article was by Miss Lizette [Woodworth] Reese, and was a story called “The White Lilacs.” It told of an elderly widow who had developed the unconscious poetry of her nature in a love for flowers. But her arbitrary sister, who has taken possession of her, has apparently no poetry in her soul at all; and does not, as the departed husband could do, tolerate poetic aspirations in another soul. We are told with humor and pathos, how the white lilacs in bloom draw the widow back to her old home; where she finds in their sympathetic presence,--and a little human too--the cause for unwonted courage and hopefulness.

The meeting adjourned.

[250]

**Meeting of April 5th, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, April 5th, 1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Mrs. John C. [Letitia Humphreys Yonge] Wrenshall, Chairman of the Committee on Archaeology.

The meeting was called to order by the First Vice President, Mrs. Wrenshall. The Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of March 29th.

The first article of the programme was by Mrs. John D. [Maud Graham] Early: and was called: “Assyria, A Sketch.” Mrs. Early gave very interesting accounts of excavations and investigations on the sites of Babylon and Ninevah and on that of the ancient city of Nippur; and she dwelt on the lessons we are taught by these far off peoples, and the message they give us across thousands of years. She spoke of their search for, and worship of the unknown God; not all unknown for that He had not left Himself without witnesses, on the banks of the Tigris, and the slopes of the Zagros mountains, we can read from their records of stone and clay,--as in their epics of the Creation and the Deluge,--which can confirm our faith in the revealed word--dear to our souls. She spoke of the very old idea that the heights of the mountains were closer to God than the low plains, and she described the artificial mountains built for His worship. She told of temples,--of one sort with idols, and another kind with no idols at all. She referred to the account of the most ancient of all written records, said to have been made by Seth, the third son of Adam, and being on baked tiles, to have

[251]

withstood injury by the waters of the Flood, which if they could be found, would be of inestimable value. She spoke of astronomical and historical tablets, also of cameos and mouldings of glass--like the modern Venetian glass, made 1400 years before Christ. She told of the old Assyrian prayers and hymns of praise, pointing out their great resemblance to the Hebrew Psalms, and to which seemed singularly like one of Father [Frederick William] Faber’s beautiful devotional poems. She asked: Will the archaeologists of four thousand years from the present time, be able to trace clearly in the records we shall leave them, and through our mistakes and errors, our true ideas of fatherhood and brotherhood in our religion?

The programme had promised an article by Miss Emma [Fenwick] Brent; but as she was absent on account of a bad cold,--it was not given.

The next article was by Mrs. Philip R. [Pearl D.] Uhler, and was on “The Royal Library at Ninevah.” Mrs. Uhler told of the discoveries in the old Assyrian cities made early in the present century, and of the more satisfactory explorations of [Paul-Émile] Botta and [Austen Henry] Layard in later times. She described the evidences now brought to light in the region of mounds and unrecognized ruins--long lying under the dominion of Arabs and Turks,--of the power and glory of Ninevah--”that great city.” She told of the more modern town of Mosul, and of its former trade in muslin,--a fabric which took its name from that place. But the interest of the region now centers in the palaces, tombs and temples, and still more in the inscriptions and the wonderful records on thousands of tiles in cuneiform lettering. After telling of old Ninevah,

[252]

the city of three days journey in extent, according to the prophet Jonah, she described the discoveries of George Smith and other patient explorers, of Frenchmen and Americans, up to the year 1895. She then told of the great works ascribed to the King Asshur-daunifal [Ashurbanipal],--called by the Greeks, Sardanapalus; and gave a description of his royal library, with its books of clay tablets and tiles; now unearthed for the enlightenment of our times in the history, the astrology and astronomy, the culture, business life and manners, of the ancient Ninevites. Mrs. Uhler then gave some very striking translations from these curious tomes. One was the lament of a mourning lover longing for the sight of the dear head now in Death’s domain. Another was a penitential prayer, pleading that God may be appeased,--the Istar, the mother may be appeased, and that the soul which had sinned unknowingly might have peace. It told of the same stirring of the human soul to “acquaint itself with God,” “and be at peace,” that was in the days of Job,--and before and after them.

The end of the programme was announced; and the meeting adjourned

**Meeting of April 12th, 1898.**

The Womans’ Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, April 12th, 1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Mrs. John C. [Letitia Humphreys Yonge] Wrenshall, Chairman of the Committee on Archaeology.

The President called the meeting to order, and gave an appropriate “Easter Greeting” to the Club. She also read some short poems relating

[253]

to the returning Spring season. The first called “April,” was given us from a new volume by our honorary member, Mrs. Florence Earle Coates, prefaced with the wish that she could have read it to us herself. From the same author was read a graceful little “Love Song.” Other poems were given from a new book by our fellow member Mrs. Sidney [Clara B. Newman] Turner, called “Mail from Nowhere.” They were “Good Morning,” and “A Spring Song.” The President also read a poem “To the Maryland Yellow Throat,” by Mr. Van Dyke, whose late lectures in Baltimore have been heard with great pleasure.

The Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of April 5th.

The first article of the programme was given by Miss Fannie H. Shackelford, and was on “The Book of Beginnings and Generations.” Before reading, Miss Shackelford spoke of what has been called of late “the higher criticism.” She told us the use of scientific scholarship in the study of the sacred scriptures ought not to result in any less love or reverence in us, but ought to increase both for our religious faith. She spoke of the clear vision given to the ancient prophets, seers and poets, on the Nile and on the Tigris, as shown in the earliest religion and the earliest literatures. She went on to speak of the city of Ur of the Chaldees,--a great city long before Abraham’s time,--from which Abraham came away, bringing with him “The Book of Beginnings and Generations.” This book is represented to us now by the first eleven chapters of Genesis. Miss Shackelford then spoke of the Cosmology of Genesis; and of the other ancient records and

[254]

traditions of Creation and Development, as seen in the light of modern research. She compared the Edenic Cosmology especially with the Babylonian one, taking up many points of resemblance, and of great interest. Going on to the days of Noah, and to the descendants of Shem enumerated at the close of the book of the generations, she pointed out the evidence of the eternal search after God, by the spirit of man from the beginning of his life on earth. She spoke too of the liberal interpretation that now is given to metaphors and glowing symbolism<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">s</span>in the most ancient records, and of the present earnest stirring to learn the truths set forth by them.

The next article was given by Miss Emma [Fenwick] Brent, and was on “The Assyrian Religion.” After remarking some peculiarities of the Assyrian language, its name etc., Miss Brent spoke of the recorded foundation of Babylon by Nimrod, and of Ninevah by Asshur. She told of the early worship of the heavenly bodies, and especially of the gods Baal and Ishtar representing the Sun and the Moon. There was at first, we find, the reaching out after the one Supreme God, who in time came to be venerated in the visible forms of his greatest and most glorious ministers. The degeneration into idol worship was then described. Miss Brent then spoke of the Chinese in whom she has been interested, and said that the most intelligent of them will give one to understand that they do not worship their idols themselves, but that they reverence and adore the great power whose attributes are represented by the images before [which?] they are accustomed to bow down. She [illegible] quotations of great interest

[255]

From high authorities on the ancient Assyrian religion. She read the Chaldean account of the Deluge, which tells us that Ishtar wept for the destruction of her people. Miss Brent closed by reading the poem of Byron on the “Destruction of Sennacherib.”

The last article of the programme was by Mrs. M. W. Sloan, and was on “A Scrap from a King’s Robe.” Mrs. Sloan illustrated her article with a map of the course of the river Tigris, showing the situation of Babylon and Ninevah, and also by a picture of the section of a King’s robe, showing its symbolical ornamentation. She pointed out the site of Babylon on a plain, and that of Ninevah in a more mountainous country, showing that there was plenty of stone in Ninevah, though the builders of Babel “had brick for stone.” We were reminded that in more sense than one, stone, made by God, stands for truth, while brick made by man is artificial, and it was said that the Assyrian externalism used stone in building only as a cover for brick. Mrs. Sloan contrasted the art of Assyria with that of Egypt,--the Egyptians being more expressive, more given to portraiture but stiff and heavy,--the Assyrian more decorative, having much beauty, but with too much of that kind of symbolism that is death to real art. The Assyrians were strong and vigorous, and it has been said that they thought in adjectives, and could not create abstract ideas.

Mrs. Sloan compared their symbolical monsters with the Greek ideals of truth and beauty. They had not the Greek sense of proportion, the body was a rack to hang clothes upon. We read in the book of Joshua of “the

[256]

goodly Babylonish garment” that Achan hid in his tent; and in that of Ezekiel of the Assyrians “clothed most gorgeously.”

Mrs. Sloan then explained her picture from the King’s robe. She showed the fine patterns, conventional figures, and apparently heraldic designs on the tapestry that was part of a royal robe thousands of years ago.

After conversation, the meeting adjourned.

**Meeting of April 19th, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, April 19th, 1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Mrs. R. M. [Elizabeth J.] Wylie, Chairman of the Committee of Art, and Miss [Louise] Malloy, Chairman of the Committee of Dramatic Art.

The President called the meeting to order, and the Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of April 12th. The President announced that we had been promised the pleasure of an article by Miss Julia Marlow,--Mrs. Tabor [actress, Mrs. Robert Taber],--to be read by herself; but that Miss Marlow had sent us word that from indisposition she would be unable to have the pleasure of meeting again this afternoon the Woman’s Literary Club, and that her article would be read by the Chairman of the Committee on Dramatic Art.

The first article of the programme was by Miss [Jane] Zacharias, and was called “Some Old Pictures under April Boughs.” Miss Zacharias spoke of having been some days ago in the Congressional Library at Washington,

[257]

and while feeling the influence from outside of the green earth and the April boughs, she was attracted by a sentence on the walls from Sir Thomas Brown, “Nature is the art of God.” She spoke of the beauty and delight, the messages without speech--that come to us from Nature, and from all true art. She then gave us a description of the pictures that have been lent to the Woman’s Literary Club by her brother, Mr. George Zaharias, who brought them to this country on his return from a sojourn of seven years in Heidelberg, and two years in Rome. The first picture represents St. Jerome, and was sold after the secularization of a monastery. It gives us this Saint of the fourth century holding a roll supposed to be part of his translation of the Scriptures, and with the worn body that lived in the desert, but with the eyes that show his unworn spirit.

The second picture was the “Christ Child” of the Spanish type, and said to be of a date not later than 1550. The third picture was a Madonna and Child of the school of Murillo. The largest picture represents “The Finding of Romulus and Remus.” The treatment of the traditional details in this picture was pointed out and explained. The President spoke of our pleasure in listening to a description of the pictures kindly lent to us.

The next article of the programme was “Three Poems,” by Miss Virginia [Woodward] Cloud. The first was called “Palilia,” [“Parila?”] and seemed to take us back in spirit to the ancient Roman festivals of Pales, the goddess of sheepfolds and pastures. The second recalled the sunshine that springtime brings to the heart. The third poem was called “The Song

[258]

of Joy,” and told eloquently of what has been called the “joy in the heart of pain.” Miss Cloud’s poems were read with sympathy and effectiveness by Mrs. Thomas J. Morris, and were followed by cordial applause.

The next article of the programme was by Mrs. R. K. [Lucy Randolph] Cautley, and was “Reminiscences of Holman Hunt.” Mrs. Cautley explained that she would have thought it impertinent to criticize the art of Holman Hunt, but having seen him in 1887, and having enjoyed his company in 1895, she proposed to talk of him for a little while. She described the first time she was taken down to dinner by Mr. Hunt, and found him delightful, and then told of his clear blue eyes and the charm of his conversation. She spoke of his life in the East, and of his practice of painting his pictures in the places where the events or scenes he commemorates actually occurred,--his scenes from the Bible having been painted in Palestine. He lived and studied there in order to look, not from the occidental but from the oriental point of view--upon those revelations given “to the Jew first, and afterwards to the Gentile.”

Mrs. Cautley gave an interesting account of the so-called Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which at first consisted of Hunt, Millais and Rossetti. They were not, she said anti-Raphaelites, they considered Raphael the crown and culmination of the school that preceded and educated him. She spoke of Holman Hunt’s pictures--of the well-known “Light of the World,” and of “The Scape Goat,” on the shores of the Dead Sea, with eyes full of human suffering. “The Triumph of the Innocents,” “The Shadow of the Cross,”

[259]

and “The Strayed Sheep,”--who make us want to lead them back to the fold. Mrs. Cautley also showed an etching by Mr. Hunt, given her by himself.

The next article of the programme was by Miss Julia Marlowe, and was read by Miss [Louise] Malloy. It was on “The Women of Shakespeare.” Miss Malloy spoke of the pleasant messages sent by Miss Marlowe, to the Club expressing her enjoyment of her meeting with us on former occasions, and her hope to meet us again. Miss Marlowe’s article reminded us that women ought to be particularly grateful to Shakespeare for recognizing in his day the dignity of womanhood, when sneering and depreciation was the custom of his contemporaries, and for crowning with his genius the true worth which he understood and appreciated. She spoke of Rosalind as his most beautiful creation. Juliet may have natural sweetness and innocence; but Rosalind makes us feel the influence of her charm,--her grace and delicacy. Beatrice is harder and not so sweet. Of Viola, she spoke as generously sacrificing her own love in her loyalty to Olivia--to one of her own sex. Miss Marlowe said that to act Shakespeare was difficult, though the difficulties may not appear on the surface; but that it was a privilege--to be accepted in a spirit of reverence.

The programme being ended, the Club and its guests engaged in conversation, while coffee was served.

The meeting adjourned.

[260]

**Meeting of April 26th, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, April 26th, 1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. The President called the meeting to order; and the Recording Secretary read the minutes of April 19th.

The President read a note from Mrs. Julia Marlowe Tabor [Taber], conveying her thanks for the beautiful flowers sent to her after our last meeting, and expressing her hope to meet the Club again on some future occasion.

An invitation was read to the artists in the Club to attend the “Artist’s Fête” given by the “Lend-a-Hand Club” of Mt. Washington. The President also gave the kind remembrance sent from France to the Club by its honorary member, Madame Blanc. Announcement was made of the business meeting of the following Tuesday, for the reception of reports.

The first article of the programme was by Miss Annie W. Whitney, and was called “A Monologue.--The Plimmerton Bank Mystery.” The monologue was the story of an attempted bank robbery,--apparently well-planned, and carried out; but as a robbery entirely unsuccessful. It is related to a Judge at his home by a man hitherto unsuspected--it appears--of complicity in crime or connection with criminals. There is psychological and sociological interest in this story of one who started in life as a thief among thieves; but, in an entirely new environment, has succeeded in leading a respectable life, and has, as Francis Bacon says “given

[261]

hostages to fortune,” in a wife and children. He is discovered by his former associates, and recognized as their best possible ally and seemingly forced to aid them. But the reclaimed citizen at the final moment brings to naught their well laid scheme with a simple device that had amused his children. He closes his story with the assertion that the bank owes him nothing; adding “It was my wife and children that saved the bank: and I am proud of them.”

The next article of the programme was by Miss Ellen Duvall; and was an “Essay A Shakespearean Study.” Miss Duvall spoke of the much quoted saying of Ruskin that Shakespeare has not heroes, but heroines. She went on to describe his heroes and his presentation of heroism. He was dominated by the chivalrous idea, as we have the modern idea of the gentleman derived from the old ideal of the knight. Miss Duvall spoke of the knight’s three-fold vow,--of all that it meant and the service that it required. She spoke too of the humility that is allied to self respect as truly exemplified in Shakespeare’s finest characters.  We were reminded that we hear of “art for art’s sake,” but that the artist is what the man is,--his art is not separate from his character. Miss Duvall went on to illustrate her subject with quotations from the great master, and with the most appreciative characterization of Shakespeare’s noblest men and women. She dwelt on his knowledge of good in human nature, and in active life, and on his comprehension of knightly service, as the summing up of true chivalry.

[262] 

The President announced that any names of proposed new members of the Club could now be sent in due form to the Secretary for action by the Board of Management.

The next article of the programme was by Mrs. Frederick [Florence McIntyre] Tyson, and was a “Critique,” on “The Mystics.” Mrs. Tyson spoke of the charm that mystery has always possessed for the mind of man,--shown in his legends and superstitions, and in his religions. The Jew had his “holy of holies,” into which the high priest alone was allowed to enter;--the Greek had his Eleusinian Mysteries, which were scarcely to be spoken of; the Buddhist reverences his holy places; and even the materialistic religious system of Mohammed, was introduced with visions and revelations. The mysteries of Nature are brought under the great light of Science, but the mysteries of life and spirit abide with us still. Mrs. Tyson then spoke of the mysteries we feel to be in Millet’s picture of “The Angelus” or in Titian’s grand “Assumption of the Virgin;” and went on to speak of the statue of a young girl, before which she watched the faces of those who gazed upon it, and saw the worldliness fade away, and the better nature of their own youth grow visible once more.

She then spoke of one of the mysteries in literature, Moritz Maeterlinck, a Belgian; who writes in French. She spoke of him as a strange suggestive writer of whom it has been said that he “has invented a new kind of a shudder.” She told something of his personal history, of his favorite authors; and of his dark vague sad treatment of the realities and the mysteries of life. She gave a description

[263]

of his weird allegorical creation “The Blind;” and also of the wonderful piece of writing “The Intruder.” The President afterwards called attention to the strange power with which we are made to feel the coming and the presence of the great “Intruder,” while the name “Death” is never mentioned. Mrs. Tyson closed her article by giving us a translation of a Chanson of Maeterlinck, called “Melisande,”--a poem, which we could all appreciate and admire.

We next had the pleasure of listening to a “Story,” by Miss Virginia [Woodward] Cloud, called “Nell Williams and her Soldier,”--one of ten Revolutionary stories, now in course of publication. The scene was laid at and near Valley Forge, in the year 1777. Little Nellie Williams and her soldier were both true Americans, and the soldier was the great commander, whom true Americans since those days have reverenced more and more as the years have passed away.

The programme closed with an “Article” on Dramatic Criticism, by Miss Louise Malloy. She spoke of the character of dramatic criticism in former days, and of its decline to the state in which we are now accustomed to find it in the daily press. The critical and judicial ability, the knowledge of the drama, the experience, the force without exaggeration of the old conscientious critic, belong to the traditions of journalism. But when the performance closes at eleven or twelve at night, what chance has the impartial critic, under the pressure to make this article ready for the public as it sips its coffee the next morning.

Miss Malloy told of an accomplished writer, who was engaged by one paper, and

[264]

who began by preparing a very fine critical essay, only to be told that the world had turned on its axis several times since that play was performed, and that the comments of another employee had been published at the time they were wanted. The commercial spirit is all-powerful; money must be made and the critic must contribute to the making. Surely, remembering his want of time and often want of material for honest criticism, we ought to give him a truly charitable judgment.

After conversation the meeting adjourned.

**Meeting of May 3rd, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, May 3rd,1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This was a business meeting limited to the members of the Club.

The President called the meeting to order, and the Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of April 26th.

The President spoke of the arrangement of our meeting room on this occasion as having been that it might be photographed;--which had been done before the arrival of the members. Copies of the photographs could be procured if desired.

The President then spoke of the reception proposed to be given by the Club to the East Indian Pundita, Rama Bai, in her visit to Baltimore, on the 19th of May, which is believed to be of great interest to all women on account of the work she has done, and is still doing for the women of India, especially for the relief of child widows, and of others who are in great

[265]

Need of the rights we ourselves enjoy.

Announcement was made of a gift to the Club,--the poems of Mrs. Florence Earle Coates, our honorary member. They were presented by the author, through the hands of Mrs. [Maud Graham] Early.

The President also announced that members who have published any literary work during the last year, are requested to send information of such publications to Miss Brent, who wishes to make a resumé of such work done by the Club.

The business before the Club was the reading of the Reports of the Standing Committees. They were of great interest,--showing the work done in the Committee meetings, by individual members, and in the regular meetings of the whole Club,--and the work proposed for the future.

The first report given was that of Miss Brent, Chairman of the Committee on “The Exact Study of the English Language.” She was followed by Miss Cloud, “On Fiction,” Mrs. [Aileen B. C.] Dammann “On Current Criticism,” Mrs. Wrenshall “On Archaeology,” and Mrs. [Caroline Canfield] Bullock, “On Education.” Mrs. Franklin Chairman of the Committee on Science gave suggestions on methods of earnest scientific study. She was followed by Mrs. Wylie, with the report from the Committee on Art. Miss [Mary F.] Grace “On Translations,” Mrs. Carter “On Philanthropy,” and Miss [Lizette Woodworth] Reese “On Modern Poetry.” The report of Miss [Jane] Zacharias “On Music,” was read by Mrs. Uhler. Miss [Louise] Malloy, Chairman of the Committee on the Drama, was not present; and Mrs. Stabler, Chairman of the Committee on Unfamiliar Records, was prevented by illness from giving

[266]

her report. The President congratulated the Club on the good work done during the year. Informal entertaining and humorous remarks were made by different members, with regard to the enjoyment and improvement to be gained from Club work and associations. The President spoke of maintaining a centre of sympathetic and kindly criticism, which is helpful and inspiring to all of us. She then spoke of the excellent work done by one Committee not named on the Programme of Topics, but known and well appreciated as the House Committee,--consisting of Mrs. Carter, Mrs. Uhler, and Miss Zacharias. A note of thanks for the good and successful work done by the House Committee was moved, seconded, and passed unanimously.

The meeting then adjourned.

**Meeting of May 10th, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, May 10th, 1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Mrs. J. Francis [Aileen B. C.] Dammann, Chairman of the Committee on Current Criticism.

The President called the meeting to order. The Recording Secretary suggested that the minutes of the meeting of May 3rd, which were the records of the reading of Reports should be omitted.

The announcement was made that the next meeting, on May 17th, would be devoted to the nominations of officers, to be voted for

[267]

on May 24th. The President also appointed as auditors of the Treasurer’s Report, Miss [Anne Weston] Whitney and Miss Duvall.

The first article of the programme was by Mrs. R. K. [Lucy Randolph] Cautley, and was given as: “Short Talks, inviting discussion on a few Poets.” Mrs. Cautley said that with those who are called poets, as with other men, “Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.” Of the third kind she reckoned Stephen Phillips, as having been thrust forward by some of his critics who claim him as one of the immortals, when he is, perhaps, not a poet at all, but only a writer of good verses. After dwelling on the characteristics of these verses, Mrs. Cautley introduced the reading of three poems, as being on nearly the same subject, treating of parting, separation and death, and as being of positive comparative and superlative degrees of merit. The first was by Stephen Phillips, and was called “A Memory,” recalling roses under snow, and joy after pain. The second was from William Watson, “A Farewell,” made too late,-- “So ancient and far off is yesterday, It is too late to say farewell.” The third was by Christina Rosetti, on “Parting,” the parting of those who were not permitted to love because there is only one heaven, and they would not close the one heaven against each other;--and told with a depth of true womanly feeling and tenderness. Discussion was invited and interesting comments followed on the poets of Mrs. Cautley’s article.

The next article of the programme was by Mrs. W. R. [Caroline Canfield] Bullock, and was on William Morris, especially on his posthumous romance

[268]

“The Sundering Flood.” Mrs. Bullock discussed this strange romance of the faithful love of a boy and girl on different sides of a sundering flood. She went over the story of their adventures with its happy ending, and dwelt on the question whether it was all written with any moral purpose, or whether the characters were idle puppets made for pleasure,--or meant to take us out of our busy life into a fair land of dreams. She suggested that a purpose might be found. We are held before these pictures, we too have had our days of witching and imagination, of great delight. She spoke of the work done for our language by William Morris and others by the employment of words that have seemed to be dropping out of use. Morris’s stories are not perhaps from the Christian point of view, but they show the old Teutonic faith, love of freedom, respect for women, self confidence and courage. He carries a message for us; he made a crusade against ugliness, everything yields to his effective hero, to do right is the graceful; but deepest springs of our nature are not touched by him, and we return from him at last to those who sing to harps of deeper tones. Some very appreciative comments followed Mrs. Bullock’s review.

The next article of the programme was by Mrs. Thomas J. Morris, and was on “The Romance of Isabel, Lady Burton,” edited by W. H. WIikins, being the autobiography of Lady Burton concluded after her death from her letters and papers. Mrs. Morris said this was the romance of two lives and there is no more perfect example of wedded love than is here described,--the well spring

[269]

in the woman’s heart gave her happiness and best development. Her perfect religious faith lived side by side with her love for one who had no religion. She, a Roman Catholic, an Arundell, of a race proud in Church and State, married against the will of her family, yet held her Richard next to her God. We were told of devotion, service and self-abnegation, and at the last of an act that has met criticism, even denunciation. She had been accustomed to prepare her husband’s works for the press. He finished, we have been told, just before his death. The translation from the Persian of “The Scented Garden,” a work of such character that its oriental author is said to have prayed to be forgiven, and saved from the hell he dreaded. Richard Burton told his wife this book was the provision he left for her support. Mrs. Morris described how, after he was dead, his wife met the question, whether she could provide for the wants of her perishing body with the profits of what she believed might destroy the souls of her fellow mortals?--and how, after prayer for guidance, in recognition of a higher duty than even that to the dead, she went into her husband’s study, and sheet by sheet burned up the thing she believed unholy. She was poor after that, and there was an outcry against her action, but can we deny that it was heroic?

The next article of the programme was by Miss Ellen Duvall, and was on “Professor William James, and Lyman Abbot.” Miss Duvall spoke of the late contributions of these two writers to the theological

[270]

literature of this closing nineteenth century. She reviewed the arguments of Professor James on “The Will to Believe,” and of Lyman Abbott on “The Theology of an Evolutionist,”--and their treatment of the relations between faith and science. She described with scholarly and philosophical criticism, the books that she thought to have been written in a broad minded and liberal spirit, and worthy the attention of all who care for high thinking with noble aims. Interesting comments were made on the views of Lyman Abbott by Mrs. Cautley, followed by further criticisms relating to the “new theology.”

The next article of the programme was by Miss Shackelford, and was called “The Intimation of a Higher Life.” Miss Shackelford quoted Herbert Spencer, and also Le Conte’s formula of evolution; but wished to make a slight change in the latter’s words. Instead of making it “continuous progress and growth under conditions of resident forces,” she would call it “continuous progress and growth by means of inherent forces.”--a simple truth as old as man, or older--and not simply a working formula. People who study social, moral, and religious and spiritual questions are not now afraid of new names. The thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns; spiritual motion is discernable all over the world, and we see the dawn of a better and higher civilization.

Miss Shackelford went on to speak of the council who met not long ago at the University of Chicago to form elective courses for the study of the Bible. She spoke of the welcome accorded to the work done in the [illegible] Polychrome Bible. She described this

[271]

late valuable contribution to our knowledge of the Scriptures; but thought that in one or two instances the change of works was not an improvement upon those of the older version,--where the sense was the same. For instance the expression “The wrath of the Lord was kindled against them,” is in one case changed to “incensed,” and in another to “exasperated.” But the ripest scholarship in Europe and American has been engaged in this work.

The President then repeated the notice of the reception to be given by the Club on Thursday, May 19th, to the Pundita Rama Bai [Ramabai] who is expect to make a short address. This reception will take the place of our month Salon.

The meeting adjourned.

**Meeting of May 17th, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore met on Tuesday, May 17th, 1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This was a business meeting for the nomination of officers and directors,--previous to the annual election to which none but members were to be admitted.

The meeting was called to order by the First Vice President, Mrs. Wrenshall; and the Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of May 10th.

Some time was given to the consideration of specimens of the photographs of our assembly rooms,--the question being raised: Whether this picture should not be taken again, in a larger view? It was decided that if this would not involve further expense, another view of the room

[272]

should be taken, otherwise we would keep the one we have. Mrs. Edward [Eliza Butler] Stabler was requested to receive the names of our members wishing to purchase photographs of the room.

The presiding officer announced the gift to the Club of a book, “The Life of Franklin Wilson of Baltimore” from Mr. J. Appleton Wilson.

A letter was then read which had been received from the President of the Club, Mrs. Turnbull, in answer to an urgent appeal from her fellow members to allow them to re-elect her to the highest office in their gift, which she has filled successfully and gracefully for more than seven years. Mrs. Turnbull’s letter said,

“1530 Park Ave., Baltimore, 
May the seventh, 1898 

“To My Friends and fellow Members of the Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore.

It is with extreme regret that I feel obliged to decline your courteous and urgent appeal to stand for re-nomination for the office of President for the Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore.

Lack of physical strength and of the time necessary to fulfill the absorbing duties of this position, together with the call of more personal claims, make it impossible for me to undertake these duties anew; while in declining to assume them, I am surrendering one of the greatest privileges and honors of my life. I need not assure you that the

[273]

work has always been dear to me, not only because of the many gracious proofs it has brought me of your confidence and affections, but because I have hoped much for it as the centre of a stong upward, tranquillizing influence, and have taken pride in its recognition and success.

Hoping that the Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore will continue to hold steadily to its ideals and to increase in strength and influence, and with warm congratulations upon the fine work, it has produced during the year just closing.

I am respectfully and faithfully your friend,

Francese L. Turnbull.”

After the expression of great disappointment by the members present, it was agreed to send a tribute of flowers to our President the same afternoon. It was also voted that her letter should take its place in full within the minutes of the meeting; and further that the Recording Secretary be instructed to write a note to the President to convey the deep and sincere regret of her fellow members for her declination to continue as their presiding officer, and the sense of personal love that they wished also to express to her.

The business of appointing a Committee on Nominations was now in order and the presiding officer named as this Committee Miss Duvall, Chairman and Judge of Election; Mrs. Carter, Mrs. Uhler, Miss [Anne Weston] Whitney, and Mrs. [Elizabeth McCormick] Reese. Miss Whitney then called the

[274]

roll of the Club ascertaining that there were twenty-four members present. The printed ballots, or blanks to be filled up were distributed, and afterwards collected by Miss Whitney and Miss Duvall; and the Committee retired to count them.

The Treasurer’s Report for the year was now called for. The Treasurer, Mrs. Dammann gave a very full and clear detailed and satisfactory statement of all the financial affairs of the Club for the closing year. Some explanations were added and some suggestions made by the Treasurer, and other members.

Then followed a Poem by Mrs. R. K. [Lucy Randolph] Cautleycalled “War.” It gave the striking descriptions and expression of the glorious glittering side of “War,” and of its ghastly underside,--of glad martial hymns of praise, and victory, broken by the voice of Rachel wailing in despair for her children. It was finely read by Mrs. Morris.

Mrs. Wrenshall then read an account of the Pundita Ramabai, who was to be our guest on the following Thursday, May 19th. It was an inspiring account of the life and heroic work of this distinguished Hindoo [Hindu] lady for her countrywomen.

The Elective Committee now returned, and presented to the Club the names of the candidates who had received--in each case--the highest number of votes for official positions. These were as seen on the blackboard:

[275]

For President,   Mrs. Wrenshall.

              Mrs. Bullock.

First Vice President,   Mrs. Wrenshall.

                   Mrs. Bullock.

Second Vice President,  Mrs. Carter.

                    Mrs. Wrenshall.

Recording Secretary,    Miss Crane.

Corresponding Secretary, Mrs. Sidney [Clara B. Newman] Turner.

 Miss Whitney.

Treasurer,             Mrs. Wylie.

                     Mrs. Dammann.

                    Mrs. Uhler.

                    Mrs. Belt.

                    Mrs. Morris.

                    Miss Whitney.

                    Mrs. McGaw.

Mrs. Bullock said she wished to withdraw as a candidate for the highest office,--she had not time to be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">President</span>. Mrs. Wylie and Mrs. Dammann each considered herself too much engaged with other duties to serve as Treasurer of the Club. Mrs. Morris wished to withdraw from the nomination as Director.

After remonstrances and friendly discussions the meeting adjourned.

On Thursday, May 19th, 1898, the Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, gave a reception to the Pundita Ramabai of India, which was much enjoyed by the members and their friends. The Pundita’s address was of great interest, and was received with applause. The President introduced the guest of the occasion, generally, and, after the address, to the individual members.

Refreshments were served, and after social conversation the meeting broke up.

**Meeting of May 24th, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, May 24th, 1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This was a business meeting, for the annual Election of Officers and Directors;--for which no literary programme had been prepared, and to which no visitors were invited.

At a table outside of the assembly room the Judge of Election, Miss Duvall, received the signatures of members as they arrived, and gave to each signer her ballot sheet to be filled up with her choice for six Officers and three Directors.

In the absence of the President the First Vice President presided, and the Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of May 17th.

The presiding officer read a letter to the Club from our President, Mrs. Turnbull, expressing her grateful appreciation of the flowers sent to her after our last

[277]

meeting, and also of the note, which followed them, from her fellow members, telling of their great regret for her retirement from office, and the sense of personal loss felt by each and all.

A notice was read of the entertainment to be given by the Lend-a-Hand Club of Mt. Washington for the benefit of the Red Cross Society.

The Judge of Election then called attention to the two black boards on the platform. One of these was to show the names of the candidates who had received the highest and next to highest number of nominating votes,--with the notice of some withdrawals among them. On the other board were placed the names voted for, and votes received as they appeared on the tally sheet of the nominating meeting.

Mrs. Wrenshall, presiding, said, that, to prevent any possible misapprehension, she would also call attention to the fact that any and every member of the Club could be a candidate for any position in our gift, as shown by the third column of our ballot sheet,--for individual choice.

The ballots were now collected by Miss Duvall and Miss Whitney, and the Election Committee retired to count them. Informal suggestions with regard to the Literary Committees of the Club followed. In a short time the Election Committee returned and announced the result of the Election.

President, Mrs. John C. [Letitia Humphreys Yonge] Wrenshall.

First Vice President, Mrs. Waller R. Bullock.

Second Vice President, Mrs. John M. Carter.

[278]

Recording Secretary, Miss Lydia Crane.

Corresponding Secretary, Mrs. Frederick [Florence McIntyre] Tyson.

Treasurer, Mrs. Alfred Belt.

Directors, Mrs. R. K. Cautley.

         Mrs. P. R. [Pearl D.] Uhler.

         Miss Annie W. Whitney.

Congratulations followed to the officers, and also to the Judge of Election and her Committee on their successful arrangement of the business of the two meetings in their charge.

To give notice, Mrs. Tyson will continue to invite members to join her Committee.

After the announcement of the subject for the next meeting, the Club adjourned.

[279]

**Meeting of May 31st, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, met on Tuesday, May 31st, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets. This meeting was under the direction of Miss Brent, Chairman of the Committee for the day.

The President, Mrs. Turnbull, called the meeting to order; and the Recording Secretary read the minutes of the meeting of May 24th.

The President-elect, Mrs. Wrenshall read a letter from the President who is about to retire from the position she has ably and gracefully filled for seven years. Mrs. Turnbull congratulated the Club on the influence it has exerted on life and literature in our city, within the lines of conservative progress. She also congratulated the incoming President on the able Cabinet that will work with her. Mrs. Turnbull then spoke of her own continued deep interest in the Club, her wish to be counted in its charmed circle, and her belief that it will hold its own, among the “fads” and excitements around us, as a centre of tranquillizing work, and of loyalty to high aims. Mrs. Turnbull said a few words about the Ramabai Circle of Baltimore of which she is President, and told some interesting incidents in the life of the Pundita whom we had the pleasure of entertaining a little more than a week before.

The first article of the programme was by Mrs. M. [Mary] W. Beebe, and called: “A Study of the Dance, and some Characteristic Music.” Mrs. Beebe treated the dance as the spontaneous expression of natural emotions by the means of the instinct of rhythm belonging to man, as seen in uncivilized races, and coming down

[280]

to us from unknown times. The first musical instrument seems to have been the drum, rudely fashioned, but this must have been preceded by stamping of feet, and clapping of hands to measure time, before melody and harmony were known. Mrs. Beebe spoke of the characteristics of the dance, and of its appropriate music among the Chinese, the East Indians, the Africans, the Greeks and Romans, and among the cultured nations who have caused it to be called “the poetry of motion.” She spoke of its relations with military drill, and still more of its connection with religious ceremonies before--and after--Miriam the prophetess took her timbrel to sing “with dances before the Lord,” or David danced before the Ark. She told of Spanish and Italian dancing and music, and closed with dancing as related to physical culture. It has been claimed against opposition, that its tendency is to give physical self-command, which is a great helper of spiritual self-control in the supreme effort of existence.

The next article was by Mrs. Florence McIntyre Tyson, and was on “The Philippines, and our Future Policy.” Mrs. Tyson spoke of the policy of Spain as contrasted with that of Great Britain in the development of her colonies. She described the Philippines in the uncomfortable rainy season, and in

[281]

the charming dry season; told of their volcanic origin, of their cyclones, and of their earthquakes in former times,--of their scenery and of their productions. She went on to speak of the races of men who inhabit the islands. First of the Negritos,--not negroes [Negroes]--the supposed aborigines, who have retired before their conquerors, up into their mountains, where they live apart, still unconquered; and of whom one Jesuit missionary believes that they are the descendants of a pre-historic emigration from North America. We were told of the visits of Chinese pedlars to these mountains, where they can only approach the settlements of the Negritos, and leave their good for inspection; after which the barbarous people come out and take them away; leaving such valuable productions of the country in exhange, that the pedlars eventually become wealthy men.

Mrs. Tyson then spoke of the Malay and half-cast population, and of the twenty-five thousand Europeans--chiefly Spaniards. The mass of the people are Christians, who hate the Spaniards, but love the priests, and are devoted to their Church. Nowhere else, we were told, are there so many monastic establishments in proportion to the population. The conquest of the Philippines was free from those cruelties, which are related of the expeditions of Cortez and Pizarro; but which were prevented by the priests who accompanied them. Mrs. Tyson described these people as by nature indolent and extravagant, ignorant, and apparently unable to tell the truth, but not dishonest with regard to money and property. They are not polygamists, but seem

[282]

to have little family love. Still their faith and devotion are real; and, we were reminded, that the merciful Heavenly Father may also accept these poor children’s service as willingly as that of many who have the knowledge and power to live far better than they do.

The last article of the programme was “A Recitation,” by Mrs. G. J. [Sarah J.] Wilmer of “The Fool’s Prayer.” It was a striking petition to be forgiven for mistakes and thoughtlessness and irreverence. We remember that King David prayed that “the counsel of Achitophel [Ahitophel] might be turned into foolishness;” but in this poem, the King’s fool turned his foolishness into counsel.

Mrs. Wrenshall then gave some notice of the work of the Committee on Unfamiliar Records, under the Chairmanship of Mrs. Jordan [Ellen W.] Stabler; and asked for it the efforts of members interested in “Unwritten History,” and kindred topics.

The meeting adjourned.

[283]

**Meeting of June 7th, 1898.**

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore, held on Tuesday, June 7th, 1898, its annual Summer Salon,--closing the season of 1897 and 1898, at the corner of Franklin and Cathedral Streets.

The President, Mrs. Turnbull, called the meeting to order. She announced that instead of the usual minutes of a previous meeting, the Recording Secretary would give a brief resumé of the literary work of the Club during the year just passed.

After the reading of this review, we were favored with two musical selections, finely rendered by Miss [Elizabeth].

The first article of the programme was a reading by Miss Virginia [Woodward] Cloud of one of her series of Revolutionary stories called “A Red Coat.” It described some stirring incidents in the American war for independence,--the time that tried men’s souls, and women’s souls as well. In this story the courageous soul of one very young American woman was tried and not found wanting; for she was one not to be thrown off her guard by the red coat of an enemy, nor the supreme peril of a friend, but always ready to show the “endurance, foresight, strength and skill” of Wordsworth’s perfect woman, nobly planned.

The next article was given by Miss May [Garrettson] Evans, and was “The Story of a Musical Undertaking.” Miss Evans gave a clear and interesting account of the first suggestion, the beginning, the growth and progress of the Peabody Graduates School

[284]

of Music in Baltimore, to which her efforts have been directed for the past four years, with the co-operation of well-known professors and lovers of the art of music in the city--up to its late consolidation with the Conservatory of the Peabody Institute. She spoke of the experience gained in four years, and the methods adopted in teaching,--not only the possessors of musical talent, but those devoid of it, or nearly so. Miss Evans noticed too the effects which the teaching can always have on the homes of the pupils, and on the general popular taste. She gave us also something of the humorous side of teaching. One beginner designated the chromatic and diatonic scales as “chromatic and democratic,” and finding the classification wrong improved it into “chromatic and die and take a tonic.” Another spoke of Handel’s “Oratorio of The Israelites in Germany.” Answers, she said, were apt to be given entirely from a personal point of view,--like that of the little boy who defined water as: “A clear fluid, which changes color when you put your hand into it.”

We then had the pleasure of listening to the singing of two songs by a former member, and founder of the Club, Miss Louise Haughton. She was accompanied by Miss Zacharias.

We were next favored with a Recitation, given by Miss [Elizabeth Cary] Nicholas of the poem “Aux Italiens,” by Owen Meredith.”

The next article of the programme was “Two Poems” by Miss Lizette [Woodworth] Reese.

[285]

They were on “Pastures” and “Spinning Tops,” and read by herself.

The programme then called for “Parting Words” by The Retiring President. Mrs. Turnbull spoke of her deep regret in taking leave of her dear friends, as their official director. She referred to our great reason for gratification in looking back upon the work done by the Club, especially that done in the last year.--on the whole the best in its more than eight years of existence. She thought we could profit by our past, and that she could offer some few suggestions for the future. She spoke of the office she had held for more than seven years as resembling that of the conductor of an orchestra, who must think of and for each and all the separate members, while seeking to bring out and preserve harmony of thought and action in the whole band. She had been called on to preside over the symphonies of fine thoughts and high aims, in the earnest efforts of the Woman’s Literary Club, and to work for the evolution and interpretation of the true and beautiful results of its work. She went on to speak of the relations of thought and language; of the importance and influence of right words,--and of recognizing and holding to those that are right and with full allegiance to the requirements of true literary art.  Mrs. Turnbull thanked the Club for the personal kindness and loyal support that had been given to her; and in taking leave asked for the same devotion to the incoming President.

[286]

Mrs. Wrenshall, the new President, after speaking of the strong ties that bound her to the members of the Club, said it was her only regret that our much loved President, under whose wise counsels, dignified words and elevating influence our society had grown from its beginning to stand in the front rank of literary clubs, should now feel it necessary to leave her office. She herself hoped for the co-operation of the Club, in working for the elevation of literature and trusted that we shall all be true to ourselves and to each other and to our motto in the resolve to give utterance always to “womanly words.”

Miss [Elizabeth] Coulson again favored us with beautiful instrumental music, for which the President expressed our thanks. Mrs. Turnbull also read the List of Heads of Committees for the coming year; and the Programme of Topics was distributed to the members of the Club.

Refreshments were served, followed by conversation, and then came our regret--full farewells to the season of 1897 and 1898.

[END OF SEASON]
