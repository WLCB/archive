Mrs. Turner suggested that there be fewer chairs in the room at the afternoon meetings, and that those be placed nearer the platform--such an arrangement being more courteous to the speaker. At the point the President urged that the Chairmen of Committees see to it that those persons interested in that Committee be invited for the af-

[92]

ternoon thus insuring larger audiences.

The Secretary was requested to order 500 cards of invitation and envelopes to match same.

The President mentioned that the rent was due and the Treasurer was instructed to pay it as she reported $283.00 in the Treasury.

Mention was made that some of the chairs needed re-sawing.

Mrs. Powell consented to continue to serve as Chairman of the House Committee and will be responsible for the Salons but not the evening meetings unless convenient to do so. Mrs. Wrenshall stated that Mrs. Armor would serve for these evening meetings of which there could probably be three as they are expensive.

Mrs. Turner advocated these evening affairs and considers them of benefit to the Club.

Miss Stiebler wrote of the plans for the Club meetings, her unable to do anything at present, [?not sure of word] take charge of the Twelfth Night. Mr. Conradi had matter in reference to a Recital and the President will have further correspondence with him about it. Mrs. Turner has friends (Mr. Chambury and Miss Marguerite Myers) who are willing to contribute their services and our Honorary Member Miss Fletcher has partly promised to come. But the entire arrangements for these evenings were left in the hands of our efficient President.

The President and members of the Board expressed deep sympathy for our newly elected vice-president

[93]

and the secretary was requested to write a few words of love and sympathy.

After refreshments and social chat, the meeting adjourned--

The President read a request from Miss Remington for a list of the members of the Club to be included in the year’s “Blue Book.” Our list it was announced was about to be revised and the question of this revision brought up before the Board the whole subject of retaining or dropping the names upon it of those who without having formally resigned are not fulfilling the requirements and obligations of the Club membership--with regard to payment of dues or to attendance or to participation and interact in our work.

[94]

But as Miss Remington wanted the list of members immediately it was finally agreed to send her the same as it stands now, to be subject to a careful and full future revision. The standing financial and literacy of some members was discussed.

It was announced the Mrs. W. C. A. Hammel had fixed her residence at Greensboro N. Carolina but still willingly attributes to our programme. It was agreed that Mrs. Hammel should be made an Honorary Member of the Club.

A discussion followed on the advisability of condensing the business meetings--the reports of

[100]

Chairmen[<sup>[1]</sup>](#_ftn1),--to hold two instead of three meetings--the reports of Chairmen and nominations to be the program for the first meeting, and the election at the second meeting, the closing Salon to be held the third Tuesday in May.

It was decided that the Executive Board try it for the year as an experiment and ask the Club as a whole to ratify the action at a later date.

**  
Meeting of May 2nd, 1912.**

A letter from Mrs. S. A. Hill read by the President brought up the question of getting out a revised copy of the Constitution and bi-Laws of the Club. The question was discussed pro and con but no definite decision was reached.

Mrs. Wrenshall called attention to the fact that the post cards containing the notices of the business meetings, should not be sent to non-resident

[101]

members, as they are not entitled to vote.

The bill for the flowers, sent by the Club at the death of Miss Shackleford, called out an explanation by the President. Though Miss Shackleford was not a member of the Club at the time of her death, no for some years previous, she had always maintained a profound interest in its welfare, and the flowers seemed a very fitting courtesy.

As the following Club meeting would be a business meeting for the nomination of officers and directors for the year 1912-13, the illness of the Recording Secretary and the proper action of the Club under the circumstances was next discussed. It was unanimously agreed that in view of Miss Crane’s long service, her renomination and election was as little as we could suitably do by way of showing her our appreciation of her loyalty.

Mrs. Wrenshall spoke of the possibility that the Club might be asked to help meet the expenses of re-decorating the walls of the Club room and voiced her objection in view of the fact that we are renters [?not sure of mark/symbol] position in which she was sustained] by all present.

Three names had been suggested for membership in the Club, though owing to some mistake they were not sent in in the prescribed manner. Miss Perkins was proposed by Mrs. [Margaret] Fayerweather, Miss Reid by Mrs. Armor, and Miss Hill proposed a friend whose name failed to reach the Board.

[102]

It was decided to hold a short Board meeting May 14th to act upon the names.

At the conclusion of the business of the morning, the President entertained the members present in her usual delightful fashion.

**  
Meeting of May 14th 1912.**

The minutes of the previous Board meeting were read and approved, and the President explained that the failure of certain names to reach the Board in the prescribed manner was responsible for the special meeting.
