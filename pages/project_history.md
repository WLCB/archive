## About the Archive

This site is a digital repository of the papers and publications relating to the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore. A team of undergraduate students led by Professor Jean Lee Cole, Department of English at Loyola University Maryland, has engaged in the transcription and interpretation of documents relating to the Club and its members. An anthology of writings by Club members, *[Parole Femine: Words and Lives of the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore](https://www.amazon.com/Parole-Femine-Womans-Literary-Baltimore/dp/1627202528/)*, was published by Loyola's Apprentice House Press in 2019, and additional research is linked on this site under the Explore tab.
