## Constitutions
***

The WLCB revisited the mission and by-laws of the organization at different points in its history, especially when the Club decided to expand or restrict membership. Revised constitutions were copied longhand into Club minutes books, displayed at yearly membership meetings, and on occasion, set into type and printed. The documents below are transcriptions of constitutions that were issued in all three forms.

### [1890](https://wlcb.github.io/archive/constitution-1890.html)
The WLCB's first constitution.

### [1894](https://wlcb.github.io/archive/constitution-1894.html)
Constitution issued after heated debates concerning the literary focus of the Club. Several members who sought to expand the Club's purview into philanthropy and social reform left the WLCB in 1893 as a result of these discussions.

### [1902](https://wlcb.github.io/archive/constitution-1902.html)
This constitution was issued soon after the WLCB celebrated a decade in existence.
