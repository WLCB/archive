# Introducing Katharine Pearson Woods
<div style="float: left;padding-right: 30px;padding-bottom: 15px;"><img src="https://wlcb.github.io/archive/assets/img/KatharineWoods.jpeg" alt="Woods"></div>
Who was Katharine Pearson Woods? This modest, retiring woman became a passionate advocate for the working class and for literature as a powerful tool for change. In the decades surrounding the turn of the twentieth century, she published eight novels and also wrote dozens of short stories and poems, sociological studies, and book reviews that appeared in major American magazines and newspapers across the country.  A native of West Virginia, Woods spent the majority of her life in Baltimore, Maryland, where her success as a writer helped to inspire the formation of the Women's Literary Club of Baltimore. 

This page serves as the home for recovery work on Katharine Pearson Woods. An online exhibit provides an introduction to Woods's life and work, and links to her various publications, including an annotated digital edition of her first novel, *Metzerott, Shoemaker*, which launched her career. Here you can also find lesson plans for teaching the novel and recovering the history of women writers and a list of resources for further study and research.
