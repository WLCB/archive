## Membership Lists
***

The WLCB was initially restricted to a maximum of 100 members. While the number of members in the Club and attendance at weekly meetings remained remarkably consistent over the years, individual members came and went. Younger women in particular resigned and rejoined the Club as their employment or marital status changed, or as childcare and eldercare responsibilities shifted over the course of their lives. The charts included here document what we know about the evolution of membership as evidenced in dues books, membership rolls, and in the pages of meeting minutes. Work on this section of this site is ongoing.

## Club Membership
Membership is denoted by season, which began in the fall and ended the following spring. Regular documentation is extant through the 1914-1915 season; membership for subsequent years is being reconstructed through consultation of meeting minutes, media coverage of the Club, and other historical documents.

## Officers and Board

Membership logs, programs, and meeting minutes document Club officers, Board of Management members, and committee chairs for each season through 1915-1916. Names of married members have been restored to include given and maiden names where possible.
