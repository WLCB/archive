## Who were the WLCB's most published authors?
***
This text cloud visualization shows the WLCB's most prolific authors. The bigger the name, the more publications we have discovered by that author. You can click on an author's name to be taken to their publications list, which can then be sorted by date, publisher, or genre. We keep discovering more publications--and authors-- as we continue to research the words and lives of the WLCB.
