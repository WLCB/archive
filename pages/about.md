## About the Archive
The Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore was founded in 1890 by a group of educated women who wanted to get their words into print. Over the next thirty years, they met every Tuesday afternoon between October and June, hearing lectures on various topics, appreciating each other's written contributions, enjoying refreshments and each other's company.

This site is a digital repository of the papers of the Club, which were meticulously kept over the years by its members. An Aperio grant from Loyola University Maryland's Center for the Humanities is supporting a team of undergraduate students led by Professor Jean Lee Cole, Department of English, in transcribing and interpreting these papers and the writings produced by members of the Club. In addition to this website, they are publishing an anthology of writings by Club members, *Parole Femine: Words and Lives of the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore* (2019).

## About the Site

{% include cb/credits.html %}

This site was built using CollectionBuilder, which is a software built using open source components that emphasizes creating digital collections and exhibitions using static web technologies and [minimal computing principles]( https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/). The goal of minimal computing and static web technologies is to, ultimately, create a site that is more stable and consumes fewer resources over time. The core principle of sustainability was a motivating factor in selecting CollectionBuilder. 

Implementation of the site was completed jointly by Jean Lee Cole and Elizabeth James using a [West Virginia Humanities Council grant]( https://wvhumanities.org/grants/aboutourgrants/fellowship-grants-additional-information/) in 2022-2023.
