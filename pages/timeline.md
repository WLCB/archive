## Collection Timeline
***
This timeline organizes the published output of members of the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore by year. The earliest publications predate the formation of the club by several decades; most of these publications were written by the Club's founding and honorary members, who became models and mentors of the aspiring writers who joined the Club in 1890 and after. As the years pass, it's possible to see how the Club enabled the literary flourishing of Baltimore women. This [tag cloud](https://wlcb.github.io/archive/subjects.html) shows the most prolific members of the Club.
